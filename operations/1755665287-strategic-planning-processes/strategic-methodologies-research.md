# Strategic Planning Methodologies Research Summary

## Research Findings for Universal Strategic Planning Processes

### Key Methodologies Identified

1. **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**
   - Goal-setting methodology for audacious goals
   - Top-down and bottom-up objective development
   - Quantitative Key Results measurement
   - Agile and adaptive approach

2. **Balanced Scorecard Framework**
   - Multiple perspective assessment (financial, customer, internal processes, learning/growth)
   - KPI-based performance measurement
   - Strategic objective translation to actionable metrics

3. **Goal-Based Strategic Planning**
   - Reverse planning from future vision to present
   - SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - Vision-aligned goal setting

4. **Basic Strategic Planning Model**
   - Vision, mission, business objectives, values establishment
   - Step-by-step goal achievement planning
   - Progress monitoring and issue addressing

### Core Process Components

1. **Vision and Mission Development**
   - Mission: Why does organization exist?
   - Vision: Where do you want to be in the future?
   - Core Values: What principles guide decisions?

2. **Strategic Goal Setting**
   - SMART criteria application
   - Short-term (1-3 years) performance targets
   - Clear what, when, how, and who specifications

3. **Success Criteria and Measurement**
   - Specific performance targets
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Regular review cycles (quarterly and annually)

### 2025 Best Practices

1. **Timeline**: Strategic plans every 3-5 years
2. **Continuous Adaptation**: Regular review and adjustment
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Communication across all levels
4. **Dynamic Process**: Ongoing navigation of uncertainty

### Additional Strategic Frameworks

1. **VRIO Framework**: Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization
2. **Ansoff Matrix**: Growth strategy options (market penetration, development, product development, diversification)

## Design Principles for Universal Processes

1. **Project-Agnostic**: Work for any project type
2. **Systematic Methodology**: Clear step-by-step workflows
3. **Evidence-Based**: Objective validation throughout
4. **Reusable Templates**: Standard formats and checklists
5. **Scalable Complexity**: Simple to enterprise-level application

## Integration Requirements

- Compatible with existing framework processes
- Evidence-based validation throughout
- Parallel coordination capabilities
- Tool integration (TodoWrite, WebSearch, Context7)
