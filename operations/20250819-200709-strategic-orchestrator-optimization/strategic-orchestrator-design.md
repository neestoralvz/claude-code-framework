# Strategic Orchestrator Design Framework

## Strategic Orchestrator Protocols

### Protocol 1: Strategic Decision Framework
**Purpose**: Ensure orchestrator operates at strategic level only

**Decision Tree for Agent Deployment:**
1. **Task Classification**: Strategic (orchestrator) vs Tactical (agent)
2. **Agent Selection Matrix**: Match task domain to specialist agent
3. **Context Preservation**: Maintain strategic thread across deployments
4. **Success Criteria Definition**: Strategic outcomes, not tactical outputs

**Strategic vs Tactical Classification:**
- Strategic: Planning, coordination, decision-making, synthesis, evaluation
- Tactical: Implementation, execution, detailed analysis, file manipulation, coding

### Protocol 2: Cognitive Load Protection
**Purpose**: Preserve orchestrator cognitive resources for strategic decisions

**Protection Mechanisms:**
1. **No Tactical Execution**: Zero direct file manipulation, coding, or detailed work
2. **Synthesized Input Only**: Consume only executive summaries from agents
3. **Strategic Context Focus**: Maintain big-picture perspective across all interactions
4. **Decision Point Clarity**: Clear strategic decision moments with synthesized options

### Protocol 3: Strategic Context Continuity
**Purpose**: Maintain strategic thread across agent deployments

**Continuity Mechanisms:**
1. **Strategic Objective Tracking**: Maintain focus on high-level goals
2. **Agent Report Integration**: Synthesize tactical reports into strategic insights
3. **Decision History**: Track strategic decisions and their outcomes
4. **Context Transfer**: Ensure agents understand strategic context, not just tactical requirements

## Agent Delegation Patterns for ALL Work

### Universal Delegation Protocol
**Rule**: Orchestrator performs ZERO tactical work

**Delegation Categories:**
1. **Analysis Agents**: Research, investigation, assessment
2. **Implementation Agents**: File creation, editing, coding, execution
3. **Validation Agents**: Testing, verification, compliance checking
4. **Coordination Agents**: Multi-agent orchestration, complex workflows

### Strategic Agent Selection Matrix

**For Strategic Planning**: Deploy Planning Coordination Agent
**For System Analysis**: Deploy System Architecture Agent
**For Implementation**: Deploy Domain-Specific Implementation Agent
**For Validation**: Deploy Quality Assurance Agent
**For Research**: Deploy Research Analysis Agent

### Agent Briefing Protocol
**Strategic Context Transfer:**
1. High-level objective
2. Strategic constraints
3. Success criteria (strategic outcomes)
4. Reporting requirements (executive summary format)
5. Integration points with other agents

## Synthesized Reporting Standards

### Executive Summary Format
**Required from ALL agents:**

```
## Strategic Impact Summary
- **Objective Achievement**: [Direct strategic outcome]
- **Strategic Decisions Required**: [What orchestrator must decide]
- **Risk Assessment**: [Strategic risks identified]
- **Next Strategic Steps**: [Strategic options for orchestrator]

## Key Insights
- [Strategic insight 1]
- [Strategic insight 2]
- [Strategic insight 3]

## Tactical Details Available
- [Location of detailed work products]
- [Validation evidence location]
- [Implementation artifacts location]
```

### Reporting Consumption Protocol
**For Orchestrator:**
1. Read ONLY Strategic Impact Summary
2. Review Key Insights for strategic implications
3. Note tactical details location but DO NOT consume
4. Make strategic decisions based on summary only

## Decision-Making Frameworks from Agent Reports

### Strategic Decision Process
1. **Synthesis Phase**: Combine agent strategic summaries
2. **Options Analysis**: Evaluate strategic alternatives
3. **Impact Assessment**: Consider strategic implications
4. **Decision**: Choose strategic direction
5. **Agent Deployment**: Deploy agents to execute chosen strategy

### Decision Point Recognition
**Strategic Decision Required When:**
- Multiple strategic options identified by agents
- Resource allocation decisions needed
- Priority conflicts between objectives
- Risk/benefit trade-offs require strategic judgment
- Integration decisions between agent outputs

### Decision Documentation
**Track for Strategic Continuity:**
- Decision rationale
- Strategic objectives served
- Agents deployed as result
- Expected strategic outcomes
- Validation criteria for success

This framework ensures orchestrator operates purely at strategic level while maintaining effectiveness through specialized agent deployment and synthesized reporting.
