## Success Metrics and Quality Gates

### Compliance Success Criteria

**Mandatory Compliance Thresholds:**
```yaml
compliance_success_thresholds:
  minimum_compliance_scores:
    tdd_compliance_minimum: 80  # Must score at least 80/100 on TDD compliance
    bdd_compliance_minimum: 80  # Must score at least 80/100 on BDD compliance  
    domain_expertise_minimum: 75  # Must score at least 75/100 on domain expertise
    integration_compliance_minimum: 85  # Must score at least 85/100 on integration
    
  evidence_quality_thresholds:
    evidence_completeness_minimum: 95  # Must provide 95% complete evidence
    evidence_accuracy_minimum: 90  # Evidence must be 90% accurate
    evidence_accessibility_minimum: 100  # Evidence must be 100% accessible
    
  integration_success_thresholds:
    compatibility_success_rate: 100  # 100% compatibility success required
    integration_test_pass_rate: 100  # All integration tests must pass
    regression_test_pass_rate: 100  # All regression tests must pass
```

**Performance Excellence Targets:**
```yaml
performance_excellence_targets:
  aspirational_compliance_scores:
    tdd_compliance_target: 95  # Target TDD compliance score
    bdd_compliance_target: 95  # Target BDD compliance score
    domain_expertise_target: 90  # Target domain expertise score
    integration_compliance_target: 95  # Target integration compliance score
    
  continuous_improvement_metrics:
    compliance_improvement_rate: "5% improvement per iteration"
    evidence_quality_improvement: "Continuous evidence quality enhancement"
    integration_efficiency_improvement: "Reduced integration overhead over time"
    process_automation_increase: "Increased automation of compliance checking"
```
