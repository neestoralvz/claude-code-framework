# MANDATORY PLAN VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - Phase 6

## Plan Validation Against SIMPLE Framework

### Current Plan Analysis
**Objective**: Reconstruct AGENT_WORKFLOW_MAPPING.md to eliminate complexity and create streamlined 8-phase agent deployment

### SIMPLE Framework Validation

**Simple**: ✅ PASS
- Reduces 72-agent complex mapping to 8 core agents (1 per phase)
- Eliminates decision paralysis through single primary agent per phase
- Clear, understandable agent selection process

**Incremental**: ✅ PASS  
- Changes preserve existing agent files and directory structure
- Updates single mapping file without disrupting framework
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing agent references

**Maintainable**: ✅ PASS
- Simplified mapping reduces maintenance overhead significantly
- Clear separation between core workflow and specialization agents
- Easier to update and modify agent assignments

**Purposeful**: ✅ PASS
- Directly addresses delegation-advisor's identified issue
- Solves specific problem of overly complex agent selection
- Focused on functional improvement

**Lean**: ✅ PASS
- Eliminates redundant agent mappings per phase
- Removes unnecessary complexity layers
- Streamlines decision-making process

**Effective**: ✅ PASS
- Creates functional mapping that actually works for system
- Improves agent selection clarity and speed
- Enables effective workflow coordination

## Complexity Violation Check: ✅ NO VIOLATIONS DETECTED

## Framework Compliance: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT

**VALIDATION RESULT**: Plan approved for implementation
