# PATTERN DEDUPLICATION EXECUTION LOG

## Phase 1: CLARIFICATION ✅
- [x] Define deduplication scope and boundaries - Focus on commands/ directory after consolidation
- [x] Establish success criteria for DRY implementation - Extract duplicates to shared/, preserve functionality

    patterns: ["basic", "specialized", "validation"]
  
  CrossReferenceEngine.md:
    interface: generateCrossReferences(commandPath, relatedCommands)
    patterns: ["navigation", "principle_refs", "command_refs"]
  
  FrontmatterTemplate.md:
