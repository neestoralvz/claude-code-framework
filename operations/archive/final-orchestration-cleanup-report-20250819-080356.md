# Final Orchestration Cleanup Report
Generated: Tue Aug 19 08:03:56 CST 2025

## Cleanup Summary
- Total agent files processed:      147
- Files with remaining orchestration references:       25
- Backup location: operations/orchestration-removal-backup-*

## Actions Taken
1. Applied comprehensive term replacements across all agent files
2. Fixed broken YAML frontmatter in AGENT-006-workflow-coordinator.md
3. Preserved legitimate technical terms (Kubernetes, Container orchestration)
4. Removed all agent orchestration capability assignments

## Compliance Status
✅ **FRAMEWORK COMPLIANT**: Agent orchestration capabilities systematically removed
✅ **TECHNICAL TERMS PRESERVED**: Kubernetes/Container orchestration terminology maintained
✅ **ARCHITECTURE INTEGRITY**: Command-centered architecture reinforced

## Remaining References
All remaining orchestration references are legitimate technical terms in:
- Kubernetes orchestration specialist (infrastructure term)
- Container orchestration specialist (Docker/K8s term)
- ML pipeline orchestration (Airflow/Prefect workflows)

## Verification
The framework now complies with the principle: "No agent can function as an orchestrator"
