## Evidence of Need

Component extraction addresses critical architectural needs:
- **Code Duplication Reduction**: Eliminates repeated patterns through reusable components
- **Maintainability Improvement**: Centralizes component logic for easier maintenance and updates
- **Modularity Enhancement**: Creates clear component boundaries that improve system architecture
- **Reusability Maximization**: Enables component reuse across different parts of the system
- **Complexity Management**: Reduces file complexity by extracting functionality into focused components

This agent specifically targets the common problem of codebases with repeated patterns, large files, and tightly coupled code that would benefit from systematic componentization and modular architecture improvements.
