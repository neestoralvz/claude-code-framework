# PATTERN DETECTION FRAMEWORK

‚è∫ **Principle**: This framework implements [content-deduplication.md](../../../operations/content-deduplication.md) single-source truth methodology through systematic pattern identification and [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) hierarchical categorization for comprehensive duplicate pattern detection across the framework.

## üîç DETECTION ALGORITHMS

### Comprehensive Pattern Scanning
```bash
# Framework-wide pattern detection using advanced regex algorithms
grep -rE "pattern_regex" --include="*.md" . | 
awk '{print FILENAME ":" NR ":" $0}' |

```

### Multi-Dimensional Pattern Analysis
- **Structural Patterns**: Detect identical document structures, section hierarchies, and organizational patterns

- **Behavioral Patterns**: Detect similar workflow sequences and interaction patterns

### Pattern Frequency Analysis
```bash
# Success criteria pattern detection
grep -rn "success criteria\|Success Criteria\|SUCCESS CRITERIA" --include="*.md" . | 
wc -l # Count total occurrences

# Table of contents pattern detection  
grep -rn "table of contents\|Table of Contents\|TABLE OF CONTENTS" --include="*.md" . |
