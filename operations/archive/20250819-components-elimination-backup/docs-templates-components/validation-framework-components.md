# Validation Framework Components

Core validation logic and success criteria frameworks extracted from system-audit command for reusable architecture.

## Success Criteria Framework
```yaml
success_criteria:
  functional_requirements:
    - [ ] Complete system scan across all specified directories
    - [ ] All violation categories detected and categorized
    - [ ] Pattern analysis and duplication detection completed
    - [ ] Tickets generated for all actionable findings
    
  quality_requirements:
    - [ ] Four-gate validation system executed successfully
    - [ ] Engineering standards applied throughout audit process
    - [ ] Embedded principle compliance verified
    - [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
    
  architectural_requirements:
    - [ ] Command-centered execution maintained throughout
    - [ ] Agent deployment functioning correctly if triggered
    - [ ] Integrated validation framework operational
    - [ ] Workflow methodology properly implemented
    
  system_requirements:
    - [ ] No regressions introduced during audit process
    - [ ] Registry integration completed without conflicts
    - [ ] Dependencies properly validated and maintained
    - [ ] Cross-references updated bidirectionally
```

## Automated Priority Assignment
```yaml
priority_matrix:
  critical_priority:
    criteria:
      - broken_workflows: workflow_execution_failures
      - system_contradictions: authority_conflicts
      - navigation_failures: broken_links_preventing_usage
      - authority_conflicts: multiple_truth_sources
    auto_escalation: immediate
    
  high_priority:
    criteria:
      - principle_violations: embedded_principle_failures
      - clarity_issues: communication_standard_violations
      - significant_duplication: content_similarity_above_70_percent
      - definition_inconsistencies: terminology_conflicts
    auto_escalation: within_24_hours
    
  medium_priority:
    criteria:
      - formatting_issues: structure_standard_violations
      - minor_navigation: non_critical_link_issues
      - consolidation_opportunities: efficiency_improvements
    auto_escalation: within_week
    
  low_priority:
    criteria:
      - style_improvements: aesthetic_enhancements
      - minor_redundancies: small_efficiency_gains
      - optimization_opportunities: performance_improvements
    auto_escalation: scheduled_maintenance
```
