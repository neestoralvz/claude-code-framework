  OUTPUT: Compliance_Report, Violation_Identification, Correction_Guidance
```

### 3. Execution Readiness Assessment

```
EXECUTION_READINESS_EVALUATION:
  INPUT: Ticket_Specifications, Resource_Requirements, Dependency_Analysis
  
  PREREQUISITE_VERIFICATION:
    - Check dependency satisfaction and prerequisite completion
    - Verify resource availability and allocation feasibility
    - Assess technical prerequisites and environmental readiness
    - Validate stakeholder engagement and approval status
    
  IMPLEMENTATION_FEASIBILITY:
    - Evaluate technical approach viability and risk assessment
    - Check resource requirement accuracy and availability
    - Assess timeline feasibility and effort estimation accuracy
    - Verify skill requirements and team capability alignment
    
  INTEGRATION_READINESS:
    - Check system integration requirements and compatibility
    - Verify workflow integration and coordination requirements
    - Assess impact on existing systems and process dependencies
    - Validate rollback and recovery procedure completeness
    
  OUTPUT: Readiness_Status, Blocking_Issues, Preparation_Requirements
```

      - Obvious readiness gaps
    
    HIGH_IMPACT_HIGH_EFFORT (Priority 2):
      - Complex technical specification gaps
      - Comprehensive dependency analysis needs
      - Strategic alignment clarification requirements
    
    LOW_IMPACT_LOW_EFFORT (Priority 3):
