# PARALLEL ERROR HANDLING

⏺ **Principle**: This component implements [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) for systematic error recovery and applies [engineering.md](../../principles/engineering.md) through resilient system design.

## Agent Failure Recovery

### Failure Detection Framework
```yaml
failure_recovery:
  detection:
    timeout: "5 minutes"
    health_check_interval: "30 seconds"
    failure_threshold: 3
```

### Recovery Strategies
```yaml
recovery_strategies:
  restart_agent: "Restart failed agent with same context"
  reassign_ticket: "Assign ticket to different agent"
  sequential_fallback: "Complete ticket sequentially"
  abort_group: "Abort entire parallel group"
```

### Automated Recovery Procedures
- **Health monitoring**: Continuous agent status verification with timeout detection
- **Failure escalation**: Progressive response from restart to reassignment to fallback
- **Context preservation**: Maintain task state and progress through recovery operations
- **Graceful degradation**: Automatic fallback to sequential execution when parallel fails

## Conflict Resolution Engine

### Conflict Types and Responses
```typescript
interface ConflictResolution {
  conflict_type: 'file' | 'resource' | 'dependency';
  affected_tickets: string[];
  resolution_strategy: ResolutionStrategy;
  estimated_delay: number;
  automatic_resolution: boolean;
}
```

### File Conflict Resolution
- **Sequential execution**: Force one-at-a-time processing for conflicting modifications
- **Intelligent merging**: Semantic analysis and automated conflict resolution
- **Priority-based resolution**: Higher priority tickets override lower priority changes
- **Queue coordination**: Systematic ordering of conflicting modifications

### Resource Conflict Management
- **Mutex coordination**: Centralized lock management for shared resources
- **Dynamic reallocation**: Real-time resource redistribution based on priority
- **Queue management**: Fair allocation with timeout and retry mechanisms
- **Spillover strategies**: Alternative resource utilization for bottlenecks

## Error Recovery Procedures

### Agent Recovery Commands
```bash
# Restart failed agent with context preservation
restart-agent --agent agent-001 --preserve-context

# Reassign ticket to available agent
reassign-ticket --ticket MOD-016 --from agent-003 --to agent-006

# Emergency fallback to sequential execution
fallback-sequential --group group-3 --preserve-progress
```

### System Recovery Scenarios
```bash
# Scenario: Dependency deadlock detected
ALERT: Dependency deadlock in Group 3
Actions:
1. pause-affected-agents --preserve-state
2. analyze-dependency-chain --find-break-point
3. resolve-deadlock --manual-intervention
```

### Emergency Procedures
- **Critical deadline management**: Minimal scope execution with basic validation
- **Resource constraint handling**: Priority-based resource allocation and spillover
- **Quality failure recovery**: Root cause analysis with corrective action implementation

## Resilience Framework

### Failure Prevention
- **Dependency validation**: Pre-execution verification of all prerequisites
- **Resource capacity checking**: Ensure sufficient resources before task allocation
- **Agent capability matching**: Verify agent suitability for assigned tasks
- **Conflict prediction**: Proactive identification of potential resource conflicts

### Failure Containment
- **Isolation boundaries**: Prevent cascade failures through agent isolation
- **Rollback capabilities**: Systematic state restoration for failed operations
- **Partial completion handling**: Preserve successful work while recovering failures
- **Error propagation control**: Limit error impact to affected components only

### Recovery Optimization
- **Recovery time minimization**: Fastest path to operational restoration
- **Work preservation**: Maximum retention of completed progress
- **Quality maintenance**: Ensure recovery doesn't compromise output quality
- **Learning integration**: Capture failure patterns for future prevention

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Error Detection Systems
```
🚨 CONFLICT MONITORING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ RESOLVED CONFLICTS (2):
   1. File Conflict: frontmatter-template.yaml
      Resolution: Sequential execution (auto-resolved)
      Impact: +15 minutes delay
      
   2. Resource Conflict: Registry access mutex
      Resolution: Mutex coordination (auto-resolved)
      Impact: +3 minutes delay

⚠️  POTENTIAL ISSUES (1):
   1. Performance Degradation: agent-003
      Issue: 25% slower than baseline
      Action: Monitor, consider load rebalancing
```

### Alert Categories
- **Critical failures**: Immediate attention required for system stability
- **Performance degradation**: Efficiency below acceptable thresholds
- **Resource exhaustion**: Capacity approaching or exceeding limits
- **Dependency deadlocks**: Circular dependencies blocking progress

### Recovery Metrics
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)**: Average time to identify failures
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Average time to restore functionality
- **Recovery success rate**: Percentage of successful automated recoveries
- **Work preservation rate**: Percentage of progress retained through failures
