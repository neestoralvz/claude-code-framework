# PLANNING FOUNDATION

## Planning Agent Overview

### Core Philosophy

> **Meta-Orchestration Pattern**: Planning agents serve as intelligent meta-coordinators that analyze complexity, domain requirements, and organizational context to select and coordinate optimal combinations of specialized agents for strategic, technical, operational, and business domain initiatives.

### The Four Planning Agents

Planning agents operate as specialized selectors and coordinators within **Phase 6: Planning** of the mandatory 10-phase workflow methodology. Each planning agent focuses on a specific domain while maintaining integration capabilities with other planning agents for enterprise-scale initiatives.
