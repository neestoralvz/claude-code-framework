# EXECUTION ARCHITECTURE CORE

⏺ **Principle**: This engine implements [agent-selection.md](../../principles/agent-selection.md) for MANDATORY agent-first execution and applies [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) through systematic parallel orchestration.

## Core Components

### Execution Coordinator
- **Central orchestration controller** for managing parallel execution lifecycle
- **Dependency resolution management** to ensure proper execution ordering
- **Resource allocation oversight** for optimal system utilization
- **Progress monitoring and reporting** with real-time status tracking

### Agent Pool Manager
- **Dynamic agent instantiation** based on workload requirements
- **Agent lifecycle management** from deployment to termination
- **Load balancing across agents** for optimal resource utilization
- **Agent failure handling and recovery** with automatic failover

### Resource Monitor
- **System resource tracking** for CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
- **Conflict detection and resolution** for file and resource contention
- **Performance optimization** through resource allocation tuning
- **Bottleneck identification** and automatic remediation

## Execution Flow

### Core Execution Sequence
```
1. Parse execution plan
2. Initialize agent pool
3. Queue tickets by dependency groups
4. Deploy agents for parallel groups
5. Monitor execution progress
6. Handle conflicts and failures
7. Validate completion
8. Update registry and metrics
```

### Flow Coordination
- **Plan validation** ensures all prerequisites are met before execution
- **Agent pool initialization** establishes required execution capacity
- **Dependency queue management** maintains proper execution ordering
- **Parallel group deployment** maximizes concurrent execution opportunities
- **Progress monitoring** provides real-time visibility and control
- **Conflict handling** ensures system stability during execution
- **Completion validation** verifies all success criteria are met
- **Registry updates** maintain accurate system state tracking

## Architecture Patterns

### Component Integration
- **Execution coordinator** manages overall execution flow and decision-making
- **Agent pool manager** handles agent deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle
- **Resource monitor** tracks system performance and resolves bottlenecks
- **Registry integrator** maintains real-time synchronization with system state

### System Boundaries
- **Clear component separation** with well-defined interfaces and responsibilities
- **Resource isolation** prevents agents from interfering with each other
- **Error containment** limits failure impact to affected components
- **State consistency** ensures reliable system behavior across all components

## Integration Framework

### Registry Integration
- **Automatic status synchronization** for real-time progress tracking
- **Progress reporting and metrics** for comprehensive execution visibility
- **Completion validation and recording** to ensure accurate system state

### Command System Integration
- **Enhanced execution commands** for improved operational control
- **Monitoring and control interfaces** for real-time system management
- **Diagnostic and optimization tools** for performance tuning

### Validation Framework
- **Continuous validation monitoring** throughout execution lifecycle
- **Automated quality gates** to ensure standards compliance
- **Rollback and recovery procedures** for error handling and correction
