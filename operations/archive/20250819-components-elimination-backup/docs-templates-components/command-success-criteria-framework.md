# Command Success Criteria Framework Component

## Purpose
Reusable success criteria framework for comprehensive validation across command-centered architecture.

## Success Criteria Framework Template
```yaml
success_criteria:
  functional_requirements:
    - [ ] {Domain} operations executed successfully
    - [ ] {Target} achieved according to specifications
    - [ ] {Output} generated with complete accuracy
    - [ ] {Integration} completed without conflicts
    
  quality_requirements:
    - [ ] Four-gate validation system executed successfully
    - [ ] Engineering standards applied throughout {operation} process
    - [ ] Embedded principle compliance verified
    - [ ] Documentation standards maintained
    
  architectural_requirements:
    - [ ] Command-centered execution maintained throughout
    - [ ] Agent deployment functioning correctly if triggered
    - [ ] Integrated validation framework operational
    - [ ] {Domain} methodology properly implemented
    
  system_requirements:
    - [ ] {System} integration completed without conflicts
    - [ ] {Structure} updated according to requirements
    - [ ] Cross-references updated bidirectionally
    - [ ] No regressions introduced to system functionality
```

## Adaptation Guidelines
1. **Domain Customization**: Replace {Domain}, {Target}, {Output}, {Integration} with command-specific terms
2. **Operation Specificity**: Customize {operation} and {System} references to match your command's purpose
3. **Validation Depth**: Adjust criteria granularity based on command complexity
4. **Integration Points**: Specify relevant integration requirements for your command

## Usage Examples
- **Ticket Creation**: Task description parsing, category assignment, registry integration
- **System Audit**: Analysis completion, report generation, issue identification
- **Modularization**: Pattern extraction, component creation, dependency resolution
- **Review Processing**: Ticket analysis, priority assignment, execution coordination

## Component Integration
- **Reference**: `[Success Criteria Framework](command-success-criteria-framework.md)`
- **Application**: Direct embedding in command quality assurance sections
- **Validation**: Automatic compliance verification against established requirements
