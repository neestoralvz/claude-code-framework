# PRINCIPLE INTEGRATION PATTERNS COMPONENT

⏺ **Principle**: This component implements [engineering.md](../../../principles/engineering.md) principle integration standards for systematic framework application.

## Framework Principle Application

⏺ **ULTIMATE AUTHORITY**: **ALL principle application sequences are governed exclusively by [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#phase-2-apply-principles-in-load-order) as the SINGLE authoritative source.**

**CLAUDE.md serves as the ULTIMATE AUTHORITY** for all principle application. This component provides integration patterns but defers completely to CLAUDE.md for principle load order authority.

**For ALL principle application procedures, follow [CLAUDE.md Phase 2](../../CLAUDE.md#phase-2-apply-principles-in-load-order) exclusively.**

## Principle Integration Variables

```markdown
### Project-Specific Principle Customization
- **QUALITY_LEVEL**: standard | high | enterprise
- **AUTOMATION_PREFERENCE**: manual | guided | automated
- **DOCUMENTATION_DEPTH**: minimal | standard | comprehensive
- **VALIDATION_STRICTNESS**: permissive | standard | strict
```

## Custom Extensions

### Project-Specific Framework Extensions
1. **Identify project-specific requirements**
2. **Evaluate existing principle coverage**
3. **Define custom principle extensions**
4. **Integrate with core framework principles**
5. **Validate principle application consistency**
