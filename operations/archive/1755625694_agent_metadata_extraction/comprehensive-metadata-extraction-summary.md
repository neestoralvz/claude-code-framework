## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### YAML Template Structure Applied
```yaml
agent-id:
  name: "Human-readable agent name"
  description: "Concise capability description"
  tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep", "Glob"]
  model: "sonnet"
  color: "category-color"
```

### Tool Assignment Logic
- **Analysis-Only Agents**: `["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "WebSearch", "WebFetch"]`
- **Implementation Agents**: `["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep", "Glob"]`
- **Core-System Agents**: Additional `["TodoWrite", "mcp__ide__getDiagnostics"]`
- **Specialized Tools**: Context-based additions (WebSearch/WebFetch for web-related agents)

### Color Coding System
