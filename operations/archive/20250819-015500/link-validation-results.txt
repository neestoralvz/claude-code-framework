   - Principle cross-references: ✓ FUNCTIONAL
   - Template system links: ✓ FUNCTIONAL

2. THREE-TIER COMMAND STRUCTURE LINKS (Critical)

   - compositions/ tier references: REQUIRES VERIFICATION

3. CROSS-REFERENCE PATTERNS (Medium Priority)
   - Inter-document navigation: MIXED STATUS
   - Agent workflow references: VERIFICATION NEEDED
   - Template inclusion links: VERIFICATION NEEDED

4. OPERATIONS REFERENCES (Medium Priority)
   - Operations directory links: DYNAMIC CONTENT
   - Ticket system references: REQUIRES CLEANUP
   - Archive references: CLEANUP NEEDED

ERROR CATEGORIZATION BY SEVERITY:
================================================================================

SEVERITY 1: CRITICAL FRAMEWORK BREAKS (0 found)
- No critical framework navigation breaks detected
- Core execution pathways intact

SEVERITY 2: HIGH PRIORITY FIXES NEEDED (Estimated 5-15 links)
- Post-reorganization path updates needed
- Command structure references requiring updates
- Cross-reference inconsistencies

SEVERITY 3: MEDIUM PRIORITY CLEANUP (Estimated 20-40 links)
- Outdated operations references
- Archive link maintenance
- Template path standardization

SEVERITY 4: LOW PRIORITY OPTIMIZATION (Estimated 10-20 links)
- Link format standardization
- Anchor reference optimization
- Documentation cross-links enhancement

PATTERN-BASED ERROR ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

COMMON BROKEN LINK PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:

1. COMMANDS STRUCTURE MIGRATION ISSUES
   Pattern: Old flat commands/ → New three-tier structure
   Impact: Medium - affects command discoverability
   Fix: Systematic path updates

2. OPERATIONS DIRECTORY DYNAMICS
   Pattern: Timestamped operations folders
   Impact: Low - expected behavior for temporary content
   Fix: Archive cleanup automation

3. CROSS-REFERENCE INCONSISTENCIES  
   Pattern: Inconsistent relative path usage
   Impact: Medium - affects navigation reliability
   Fix: Path standardization workflow

4. TEMPLATE SYSTEM REFERENCES
   Pattern: Template location variations
   Impact: Medium - affects component reusability
   Fix: Template path consolidation

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

PRIMARY ROOT CAUSES:

1. FRAMEWORK REORGANIZATION IMPACT
   - Three-tier command structure implementation
   - Migration from flat to hierarchical organization
   - Path reference updates incomplete

2. DYNAMIC CONTENT MANAGEMENT
