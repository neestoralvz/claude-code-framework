## 📝 INDEX CREATION STRATEGY

### 1. Main Index Enhancement
- Update `/docs/agents-docs/index.md` to serve as primary navigation hub
- Add category links to actual agent directories
- Include template selection guidance
- Integrate with framework navigation

### 2. Category-Specific Indices
Creating indices for logical groupings:
- **guides/**: Navigation and deployment guides
- **reference/**: Architectural definitions and standards  
- **templates/**: Agent creation templates
- **standards/**: Quality and compliance standards

### 3. Navigation Patterns
- Consistent breadcrumb navigation
- Cross-category linking
- Integration with broader framework
- User-friendly descriptions

## ✅ DELIVERABLES
1. Enhanced main index with comprehensive navigation
2. Category-specific index files
3. Consistent navigation breadcrumbs
4. Cross-reference integration
5. User-friendly content descriptions

## 📈 PROGRESS TRACKING
- [x] Structure analysis complete
- [x] Main index enhancement
