- ✓ Focused interface definitions for specific capabilities
- ✓ Clean separation between orchestration and execution concerns

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
- ✓ Dependencies on abstractions throughout architecture
- ✓ Comprehensive dependency injection patterns
- ✓ High-level policy independence from implementation details

### Agent Orchestration Framework

**Orchestrator-Agent Separation**:
- ✓ Orchestrators use Task tools for agent deployment
- ✓ Deployed agents execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob
- ✓ Clear separation between coordination and execution responsibilities

**Coordination Patterns Implemented**:
- ✓ **Sequential Orchestration**: Dependency-ordered agent execution
- ✓ **Parallel Orchestration**: Independent task coordination with result synthesis
- ✓ **Hierarchical Orchestration**: Master-subordinate agent coordination

### Validation and Quality Assurance

**Multi-Layer Validation Framework**:

- ✓ **Domain Integration Validation**: Cross-domain consistency verification
- ✓ **Mathematical Validation**: Quantitative success criteria with evidence
- ✓ **Quality Gate Compliance**: Systematic quality standard enforcement

**Mathematical Success Criteria**:
```yaml
success_calculation:
  overall_success_score: |
    (objective_achievement * 0.30) +
    (quality_compliance * 0.25) +
    (stakeholder_satisfaction * 0.20) +
    (timeline_adherence * 0.15) +
    (resource_efficiency * 0.10)
  
  success_threshold: 0.85  # 85% minimum for success
