SYSTEM INTEGRITY VALIDATION: CRITICAL FINDINGS

BROKEN REFERENCE ANALYSIS:
========================

1. CLAUDE.md Playbook References:
   - References: commands/index.md (BROKEN - commands directory empty)
   - References: commands/COMMAND_REFERENCE_MATRIX.md (BROKEN - file in docs/commands-docs/)
   - References: commands/AGENT_WORKFLOW_MAPPING.md (BROKEN - file in docs/commands-docs/)

2. Command Reference Matrix Internal Links:
   - References: domains/workflow/index.md (BROKEN - domains structure eliminated)
   - References: engines/CoreWorkflow.md (BROKEN - engines structure eliminated)

3. Missing Critical Infrastructure:
   - commands/index.md (Referenced in CLAUDE.md but missing)
   - Complete commands directory structure eliminated

IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
=================
- HIGH PRIORITY: Main playbook navigation broken
- CRITICAL: Command selection framework inaccessible via documented paths
- SEVERE: Agent workflow mapping not accessible via documented paths

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
==================
- Orchestrator workflow guidance compromised
- Command selection matrix navigation broken  
- Agent deployment workflow references invalid
