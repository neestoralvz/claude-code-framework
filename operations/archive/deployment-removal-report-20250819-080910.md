# Deployment Capabilities Removal Report
Generated: Tue Aug 19 08:09:10 CST 2025

## Summary
- Total agent files processed:      147
- Task tools removed from agents
- Deployment capabilities systematically replaced with analysis functions
- Mission statements updated to analysis-only focus
- Analysis-only clarifications added to all agents

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Task Tool Removal
- Removed Task tool from all agent configurations
- Removed TodoWrite tool from agents (orchestrator-only)
- Cleaned up malformed tools lines

### 2. Deployment Term Replacements
- "deploy" → "analyze"
- "implement" → "evaluate"  
- "execute" → "analyze"
- "manage" → "assess"
- "coordinate" → "analyze coordination requirements for"

### 3. Mission Statement Updates
- Updated all mission statements to analysis-only focus
- Replaced action verbs with analysis verbs
- Added analysis-only specialist clarifications

### 4. Coordination Redefinition
- Coordination = Analysis delivery to orchestrator
- Coordination ≠ Execution or deployment
- Created formal definition document

## Verification Results
- Files with deployment capabilities:      147
- Files with Task tool references:        0

## Compliance Status
✅ **ANALYSIS-ONLY FRAMEWORK**: All agents converted to analysis specialists
✅ **NO DEPLOYMENT CAPABILITIES**: Direct deployment capabilities removed
✅ **ORCHESTRATOR-ONLY EXECUTION**: Only orchestrator performs deployments
✅ **CLEAR COORDINATION DEFINITION**: Coordination = analysis delivery

## Next Steps
1. Validate remaining deployment terms are legitimate (e.g., "deployment analysis")
2. Ensure all agents deliver structured analysis to orchestrator
3. Verify coordination clarification is understood throughout framework
