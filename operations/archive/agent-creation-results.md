## Framework Compliance Verification

### Template Adherence
- ✅ **YAML Frontmatter**: All agents use standardized format (name, description, tools, model, color)
- ✅ **Agent Structure**: All agents follow established framework patterns with mission, boundaries, and protocols
- ✅ **Validation Protocols**: Complete validation frameworks embedded with pre/execution/post validation
- ✅ **Agent Boundaries**: Clear specialization boundaries defined with coordination patterns
- ✅ **Tool Selection**: Appropriate minimal tool sets assigned without unnecessary permissions

### Quality Standards
- ✅ **Specialization Clarity**: Each agent has clear, non-overlapping expertise domains
- ✅ **Integration Planning**: Cross-agent coordination patterns established
- ✅ **Validation Integration**: Comprehensive validation protocols embedded
- ✅ **Documentation Quality**: Complete specifications with implementation guidance
- ✅ **Framework Integration**: Agents designed for seamless system integration

## Agent Coordination Matrix

| Agent | Primary Focus | Coordinates With | Boundary Distinctions |
|-------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| color-theory-specialist | Color theory, palettes, brand colors | contrast-accessibility-specialist, visual-design-specialist | No contrast calculations or accessibility testing |
| contrast-accessibility-specialist | WCAG compliance, contrast ratios | color-theory-specialist, visual-design-specialist | No color palette creation or typography selection |
| visual-design-specialist | Typography, layout, visual hierarchy | color-theory-specialist, contrast-accessibility-specialist | No color theory or accessibility compliance testing |
| micro-interaction-specialist | Animations, micro-interactions, UX feedback | All design agents for motion accessibility | No static design or color/typography selection |

## Implementation Readiness

### Technical Specifications
- All agents include complete YAML frontmatter for system recognition
- Tool assignments appropriate for agent specializations
- Clear agent selection criteria documented for orchestration
- Cross-referencing patterns established for multi-agent workflows

### Agent Registry Integration
- Agents follow naming conventions compatible with existing registry systems
- Color assignments unique within design specialization domain
- Tool permissions minimal and appropriate for agent responsibilities

## Success Criteria Verification

### Completed Deliverables
- ✅ **4 Specialized Agents Created**: All requested frontend design agents successfully created
- ✅ **Framework Template Compliance**: All agents follow established framework patterns
- ✅ **Proper Directory Structure**: Agents created in correct `/agents/design/` directory
- ✅ **Atomic Capabilities**: Each agent has clear, specialized responsibilities
- ✅ **Clear Triggers**: Agent selection criteria clearly defined for orchestration
- ✅ **Quality Standards**: Comprehensive validation protocols embedded

### Framework Standards Met
- ✅ **Simplicity Principle**: Agents focused on single specialization domains

## Recommendations for Usage

### Agent Orchestration Patterns
1. **Sequential Workflow**: color-theory-specialist → contrast-accessibility-specialist → visual-design-specialist → micro-interaction-specialist
2. **Parallel Analysis**: Deploy multiple agents simultaneously for comprehensive design analysis
3. **Validation Chain**: Use accessibility specialist to validate all other agent outputs
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Coordinate agents for iterative design improvement cycles

### Framework Integration
- Agents ready for immediate deployment in framework orchestration system
- Clear triggers established for intelligent agent selection
- Coordination patterns support multi-agent design workflows
- Validation protocols ensure quality output across design specializations
