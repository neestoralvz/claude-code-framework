# CLAUDE.md Success Criteria Framework

## Framework Architecture

### Success Measurement Domains
1. **Effectiveness Metrics** - How well CLAUDE.md achieves its purpose
2. **Efficiency Metrics** - How efficiently guidance is delivered and applied
3. **Quality Metrics** - How well the framework maintains standards
4. **Evolution Metrics** - How successfully the framework adapts and improves
5. **User Experience Metrics** - How satisfying and useful the framework is

### Measurement Principles
- **Evidence-Based**: All metrics must be objectively measurable
- **Actionable**: Poor scores must clearly indicate improvement actions
- **Sustainable**: Metrics must be collectible without excessive overhead
- **Relevant**: Measurements must correlate with actual framework value
- **Trend-Focused**: Changes over time more important than absolute scores

## Core Success Criteria

### 1. Decision Speed Efficiency
**Objective**: Users can quickly determine correct actions from CLAUDE.md guidance

**Primary Metric**: Average time from question to actionable decision
- **Excellent**: <30 seconds for routine tasks
- **Good**: 30-60 seconds for routine tasks
- **Acceptable**: 60-120 seconds for routine tasks
- **Poor**: >120 seconds for routine tasks

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Hesitation frequency: Times per session user pauses to re-read guidance
- Clarification requests: Number of times additional guidance needed
- Backtracking instances: Times user reverses decision due to guidance confusion

**Measurement Method**:
```bash
# Automated timing script for decision tracking
echo "Decision start: $(date +%s)" >> decision-log.txt
# User makes decision
echo "Decision end: $(date +%s)" >> decision-log.txt
# Calculate average decision time
```

**Success Validation Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Calculate average decision time from logs
awk '{decision_times[NR]=$3-prev; prev=$3} END {sum=0; for(i in decision_times) sum+=decision_times[i]; print "Average:", sum/NR "seconds"}' decision-log.txt
```

### 2. Preference Compliance Rate
**Objective**: High adherence to established preferences in actual practice

**Primary Metric**: Percentage of preferences consistently followed
- **Excellent**: 90-100% compliance rate
- **Good**: 80-89% compliance rate
- **Acceptable**: 70-79% compliance rate
- **Poor**: <70% compliance rate

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Selective application pattern: Which preferences are cherry-picked
- Degradation timeline: How quickly compliance decreases
- Context sensitivity: Compliance variation by project type

**Measurement Method**:
```bash
# Preference compliance checker
grep -c "TodoWrite used" session-logs.txt
grep -c "Progressive Thinking applied" session-logs.txt
grep -c "Evidence collection before decision" session-logs.txt
```

**Success Validation Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Calculate compliance percentage across all preferences
total_opportunities=$(grep -c "preference-check-point" session-logs.txt)
compliance_instances=$(grep -c "preference-followed" session-logs.txt)
echo "Compliance rate: $((compliance_instances * 100 / total_opportunities))%"
```

- **Poor**: 1-3 (High effort, frequent confusion)

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Cross-reference frequency: Times per task user needs multiple sections
- Memory burden: Number of preferences user must remember simultaneously

echo "Cross-references needed: $XREF_COUNT" >> cognitive-load.txt
echo "Memory items active: $MEMORY_COUNT" >> cognitive-load.txt
echo "Context switches: $SWITCH_COUNT" >> cognitive-load.txt
```

**Success Validation Script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Calculate cognitive load score based on tracked indicators
xref_avg=$(awk '{sum+=$3} END {print sum/NR}' cognitive-load.txt | grep "Cross-references")
memory_avg=$(awk '{sum+=$4} END {print sum/NR}' cognitive-load.txt | grep "Memory")
switch_avg=$(awk '{sum+=$3} END {print sum/NR}' cognitive-load.txt | grep "switches")
# Lower numbers = higher score (inverted scale)
cognitive_score=$((10 - (xref_avg + memory_avg + switch_avg) / 3))
