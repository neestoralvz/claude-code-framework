## FRAMEWORK EVOLUTION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate CLAUDE.md Updates Required
Following the "Immediate CLAUDE.md Updates" preference (Line 67), the following enhancements should be integrated immediately:

```markdown
**Framework Health Monitoring**: Automated monthly framework effectiveness assessment using systematic evaluation agent deployment. Monitors: preference compliance rates, cognitive load efficiency, decision speed metrics, protocol adherence patterns. Generates automated alerts when framework degradation detected (compliance below 85%, decision speed reduction >20%, cognitive load increase >30%). Maintains framework reliability without manual oversight burden.

**Session Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of session workflow patterns, preference usage frequencies, and optimization opportunities. Analyzes: decision speed patterns, cognitive load distribution, protocol compliance variations, strategic vs. tactical work ratios. Generates proactive optimization recommendations based on observed patterns. Maintains framework evolution without manual analysis overhead.

**Preference Conflict Detection**: Automated analysis of preference interactions and potential conflicts. Monitors: overlapping preference domains, contradictory protocol requirements, resource allocation conflicts, strategic vs. tactical preference tensions. Provides resolution suggestions based on usage patterns and strategic priorities. Maintains framework coherence without manual conflict management.
```
