# Root Cause Analysis Methodologies Research

## Executive Summary

Research into current root cause analysis methodologies reveals a landscape of established frameworks with evolving integration opportunities. The analysis covers traditional methods (5 Whys, Fishbone, Fault Tree Analysis) alongside modern systematic approaches.

## Traditional Root Cause Analysis Methods

### 5 Whys Method
**Core Principle**: Sequential questioning to drill down through cause layers
**When to Use**: 
- Simple to moderate complexity problems
- Time-sensitive analyses requiring quick identification
- Linear cause-effect relationships

**Strengths**:
- Simple implementation
- Rapid execution
- Team accessible

**Limitations**:
- May oversimplify complex systems
- Relies on subjective analysis
- Can miss parallel causation paths

### Fishbone Diagrams (Ishikawa)
**Core Principle**: Visual mapping of potential causes across categories
**When to Use**:
- Complex problems with multiple potential causes
- Team brainstorming sessions
- Comprehensive cause exploration

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive analysis capability
- Facilitates team collaboration
- Visual representation aids communication
- Systematic categorization

**Limitations**:
- Can become overwhelming with complex systems
- May generate too many potential causes
- Requires skilled facilitation

### Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
**Core Principle**: Top-down deductive analysis using tree diagrams
**When to Use**:
- High-risk industries (aerospace, nuclear)
- Complex systems with interdependent failures
- Safety-critical applications

**Strengths**:
- Quantitative risk assessment
- Systematic logical analysis
- Handles complex system interactions

**Limitations**:
- Resource intensive
- Requires technical expertise
- May miss human factors

## Integration Opportunities

### Combined Approach Strategy
Research indicates optimal results when combining methods:
- Fishbone for comprehensive cause identification
- 5 Whys for deep drilling into specific causes
- FTA for complex system analysis

### Modern Enhancement Approaches
- Digital tools for tracking and analysis
- Data-driven validation of hypotheses
- Systematic follow-up protocols

## Current Trends (2025)

### Selection Criteria Focus
Emphasis on choosing appropriate techniques based on:
- Problem complexity assessment
- Available resources and time
- Team capability and expertise
- Risk level and consequences

### Quality Management Integration
- Integration with broader quality frameworks
- Continuous improvement processes
- Evidence-based validation requirements

## Recommendations for Framework Integration

1. **Tiered Approach**: Start with 5 Whys for initial analysis, escalate to Fishbone for complex problems, use FTA for critical systems
2. **Documentation Standards**: Systematic capture of analysis process and results
3. **Validation Requirements**: Evidence-based confirmation of identified root causes
4. **Follow-up Protocols**: Systematic monitoring of implemented solutions

## Key Success Factors

- Clear problem definition
- Appropriate method selection
- Skilled facilitation
- Data-driven validation
