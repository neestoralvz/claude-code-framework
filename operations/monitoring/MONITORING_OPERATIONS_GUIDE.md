## Alert Response Procedures

### Alert Escalation Levels

**Level 1: Immediate Response (0 seconds)**
- **Triggers**: Critical threshold breaches
- **Actions**: Immediate notification + automatic remediation trigger
- **Targets**: System console + dashboard alerts

**Level 2: Automated Response (30 seconds)**
- **Triggers**: Warning thresholds sustained + pattern anomalies
- **Actions**: Automated remediation + performance optimization
- **Targets**: Dashboard alerts + integration systems

**Level 3: Emergency Response (Immediate)**
- **Triggers**: System failures + multiple critical alerts
- **Actions**: Emergency protocols + failsafe activation
- **Targets**: All channels + emergency systems

### Common Alert Scenarios

**Performance Degradation Alerts**
```
Alert: Command execution time exceeded 0.8 seconds
Response: Automatic performance optimization activation
Expected Outcome: Execution time reduction to <1 second
