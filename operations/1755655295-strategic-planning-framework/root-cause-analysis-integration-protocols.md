- Establish event probability and impact assessment
- Document system boundaries and scope for analysis
- Identify key stakeholders and system components

**Step 2: Fault Tree Construction**
- Work backwards from top event to identify immediate causes
- Use logical gates (AND, OR) to represent cause relationships
