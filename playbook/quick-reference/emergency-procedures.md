# 🆘 EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE HELP

**⚡ CRITICAL**: Use this page when you're lost, confused, or experiencing problems

---

## 🆘 EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

### 🌀 LOST CONTEXT OR CONFUSED
**SYMPTOMS**: Don't know where you are, unclear about framework, context seems corrupted

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: 📋 [System Initialization Procedure](../procedures/system-initialization.md)
STEP 2: Read architecture overview completely
STEP 3: Load directive and workflow principles  
STEP 4: Verify system readiness
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 3-5 minutes

---

### 🚫 TASK UNCLEAR OR AMBIGUOUS
**SYMPTOMS**: User request unclear, multiple interpretations possible, requirements confusing

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: ⚡ [Task Execution Procedure](../procedures/task-execution.md) STEP 1
STEP 2: Analyze task requirements carefully
STEP 3: Ask clarifying questions if needed
STEP 4: Define clear success criteria
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 1-3 minutes

---

### ❌ QUALITY VALIDATION FAILED
**SYMPTOMS**: Four-gate validation not passing, quality issues detected, standards not met

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: ✅ [Validation Checkpoint Tree](../decision-trees/validation-checkpoints.md)
STEP 2: Identify which gate failed
STEP 3: Address specific gate requirements
STEP 4: Re-run validation sequence
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 2-10 minutes depending on issue

---

### 🐛 EXECUTION ERROR OR BLOCKAGE
**SYMPTOMS**: Command execution failed, workflow blocked, unexpected errors occurring

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: 🐛 [Debug Command](../../commands/workflow/9-debug.md)
STEP 2: Identify error source and type
STEP 3: Apply appropriate resolution strategy
STEP 4: Resume execution from stable point
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 5-15 minutes depending on complexity

---

### 🎯 COMMAND SELECTION UNCLEAR
**SYMPTOMS**: Multiple command options, unclear which is optimal, decision paralysis

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: 🎯 [Command Selection Tree](../decision-trees/command-selection.md)
STEP 2: Analyze task type systematically
STEP 3: Apply selection criteria
STEP 4: Choose based on timing and context
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 1-3 minutes

---

### 🔄 INFINITE LOOPS OR RECURSION
**SYMPTOMS**: Stuck in repetitive cycles, recursive operations not terminating, circular dependencies

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: STOP current execution immediately
STEP 2: 🔄 [Return to Main Playbook](../../CLAUDE.md)
STEP 3: 🌳 [Situation Assessment](../decision-trees/situation-assessment.md)
STEP 4: Choose completely different approach
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: Immediate stop + 2-5 minutes reset

---

### 📚 DOCUMENTATION NOT FOUND
**SYMPTOMS**: Navigation links broken, files not found, documentation inaccessible

**🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION**:
```
STEP 1: 🚀 [Immediate Access Paths](./immediate-access.md)
STEP 2: Use direct navigation paths
STEP 3: Check alternative access methods
STEP 4: Report issue if paths consistently fail
```

**⏱️ TIME TO RESOLUTION**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes

---

## 🚀 QUICK RECOVERY PROTOCOLS

### 🔄 COMPLETE SYSTEM RESET
**WHEN TO USE**: Multiple issues, severe confusion, need fresh start

**🔄 RESET SEQUENCE**:
```
1. 🛑 STOP all current operations
2. 🧹 CLEAR mental context completely  
3. 🏠 RETURN to [Main Playbook](../../CLAUDE.md)
4. 📋 EXECUTE [System Initialization](../procedures/system-initialization.md)
5. 🎯 CHOOSE new path based on situation
```

### ⚡ FAST TRACK RECOVERY
**WHEN TO USE**: Minor issues, need quick resolution

**⚡ FAST SEQUENCE**:
```
1. 🎯 IDENTIFY issue type from list above
2. 🚀 APPLY immediate action for that issue
3. ✅ VERIFY resolution
4. 🔄 CONTINUE with original task
```

### 🆘 ESCALATION PROTOCOL
**WHEN TO USE**: Standard procedures not working, persistent issues

**🆘 ESCALATION SEQUENCE**:
```
1. 📋 DOCUMENT issue clearly
2. 🔄 TRY complete system reset
3. 📚 CONSULT [Documentation Hub](../../docs/index.md)
4. 🏗️ REVIEW [Architecture Overview](../../docs/architecture/system-architecture-overview.md)
```
