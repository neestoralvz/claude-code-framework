# 🌐 COMMAND CONSTRUCTION

## ⚡ TRANSLATION COMMAND NARRATIVE AUTHORITY

**🎯 EXECUTE THIS FORMATTING SYSTEM**: Apply these narrative construction commands to every translation command creation. Structure all translation instructions as imperative execution sequences that drive immediate action.

**⏱️ CONSTRUCTION TIME**: 1-2 minutes for complete command narrative formatting

**🌍 FORMATTING SCOPE**: Translation-specific command construction methodology that ensures execution clarity and cultural precision

---

## 🔧 COMMAND NARRATIVE CONSTRUCTION SEQUENCE

### 1️⃣ EXECUTE IMPERATIVE STRUCTURE FORMATION

**🎯 IMMEDIATE COMMAND FORMATTING**: Structure every translation instruction as direct action command:

```
❌ AVOID: "You might want to consider translating this as..."
✅ EXECUTE: "TRANSLATE this term as [specific term] because [reason]"

❌ AVOID: "It would be good to check the context..."
✅ EXECUTE: "VERIFY context by examining [specific elements]"

❌ AVOID: "One possible approach could be..."
✅ EXECUTE: "APPLY this translation strategy: [specific action]"
```

**⚡ FORMATTING RULE**: Begin every instruction with action verb. Transform passive suggestions into active commands that demand execution.

### 2️⃣ EXECUTE PRECISION TARGETING COMMANDS

**🎯 SPECIFICITY CONSTRUCTION**: Create commands that target exact translation decisions:

- **SPECIFY exact terminology** - "TRANSLATE 'gestión' as 'management' in business context, 'administration' in academic context"
- **DEFINE cultural adaptations** - "ADAPT 'horario de oficina' to 'business hours' for US audience"
- **COMMAND tone preservation** - "MAINTAIN formal register by using 'shall' instead of 'will' for obligations"
- **DIRECT structure decisions** - "REORDER subject-verb-object for English clarity while preserving emphasis"

**⏱️ PRECISION TIME**: 30-45 seconds per specific command construction

### 3️⃣ EXECUTE CONTEXTUAL ROUTING COMMANDS

**🎯 CONDITIONAL COMMAND CONSTRUCTION**: Build decision-tree commands for contextual adaptation:

```
🔍 IF technical documentation → EXECUTE technical precision commands
🏢 IF business communication → EXECUTE professional clarity commands  
🎓 IF educational content → EXECUTE pedagogical effectiveness commands
💻 IF software interface → EXECUTE user experience commands
📋 IF legal document → EXECUTE compliance accuracy commands
```

**⚡ ROUTING STRUCTURE**: Format as "IF [condition] → EXECUTE [specific action]" for clear decision execution.

### 4️⃣ EXECUTE QUALITY INTEGRATION FORMATTING

**🎯 VALIDATION COMMAND CONSTRUCTION**: Embed quality checks within command narrative:

- **VERIFY accuracy** - "CONFIRM technical term accuracy by checking domain glossary"
- **VALIDATE coherence** - "ENSURE logical flow by reading translated paragraph aloud"
- **CHECK cultural appropriateness** - "VERIFY cultural adaptation by considering target audience context"
- **CONFIRM completeness** - "VALIDATE all source content reflected in translation"

**⏱️ VALIDATION CONSTRUCTION**: 15-30 seconds per quality integration command

---

## 📋 NARRATIVE FLOW CONSTRUCTION COMMANDS

### 🎯 EXECUTE SEQUENTIAL COMMAND CHAINING

**IMMEDIATE SEQUENCING**: Structure commands as continuous action flow:

1. **ANALYZE source text** → **IDENTIFY terminology** → **RESEARCH context** → **EXECUTE translation**
2. **TRANSLATE core meaning** → **ADAPT cultural elements** → **VERIFY tone** → **CONFIRM accuracy**
3. **REVIEW translation** → **CHECK coherence** → **VALIDATE completeness** → **DELIVER result**

**⚡ CHAINING RULE**: Each command must logically connect to next action without interruption of execution flow.

### 🔍 EXECUTE DECISION POINT FORMATTING

**SYSTEMATIC CHOICE CONSTRUCTION**: Format decision points as immediate action triggers:

```
🎯 DECISION REQUIRED: Choose translation approach
├── TECHNICAL PRECISION → Execute domain-specific terminology commands
├── CULTURAL ADAPTATION → Execute context integration commands
└── BALANCED APPROACH → Execute standard translation commands

⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION: Select approach based on analysis results and execute corresponding command sequence
```

**⏱️ DECISION FORMATTING**: 20-30 seconds for complete decision point construction

### 🔄 EXECUTE FEEDBACK LOOP INTEGRATION

**CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT COMMANDS**: Build iterative refinement into command narrative:

- **REVIEW translation result** → **IDENTIFY improvement opportunities** → **REFINE execution**
- **CHECK against source** → **VERIFY all elements translated** → **ENHANCE accuracy**
- **VALIDATE cultural fit** → **ADJUST adaptation strategy** → **OPTIMIZE appropriateness**

---

## 🧠 NARRATIVE PRECISION COMMANDS

### 🎯 EXECUTE CLARITY OPTIMIZATION

**IMMEDIATE CLARITY CONSTRUCTION**: Eliminate ambiguous language from command narrative:

```
❌ UNCLEAR: "Try to make sure the translation sounds natural"
✅ CLEAR: "READ translation aloud to verify natural speech rhythm"

❌ VAGUE: "Consider the cultural implications"
✅ SPECIFIC: "EVALUATE cultural references for target audience appropriateness"

❌ PASSIVE: "The translation should be checked"
✅ ACTIVE: "VERIFY translation accuracy against source text"
```

**⚡ CLARITY RULE**: Every command must specify exact action with measurable completion criteria.

### 🔍 EXECUTE COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION

**SYSTEMATIC COVERAGE COMMANDS**: Ensure command narrative addresses all translation aspects:

- ✅ **SOURCE ANALYSIS** - Commands for text examination and understanding
- ✅ **TERMINOLOGY MANAGEMENT** - Commands for specialized vocabulary handling  
- ✅ **CULTURAL ADAPTATION** - Commands for context-appropriate modifications
- ✅ **QUALITY ASSURANCE** - Commands for accuracy and completeness verification
- ✅ **DELIVERY OPTIMIZATION** - Commands for final presentation and formatting

**⏱️ COMPLETENESS CHECK**: 45 seconds for comprehensive command coverage verification

### 🎯 EXECUTE USER GUIDANCE INTEGRATION

**NAVIGATION COMMAND CONSTRUCTION**: Build clear routing into command narrative:

```
🆘 IF CONFUSED → Execute [Translation Emergency Commands](./translation-emergency.md)
🔧 IF TECHNICAL → Execute [Technical Translation Commands](./technical-translation.md)
🧠 IF CONTEXT NEEDED → Execute [Context Integration Commands](./context-integration.md)
✅ IF VALIDATION → Execute [Translation Validation Commands](./translation-validation.md)
```

**⚡ GUIDANCE STRUCTURE**: Provide immediate routing for any execution uncertainty or special requirements.

## ✅ COMMAND CONSTRUCTION VALIDATION

### 🔄 EXECUTE NARRATIVE QUALITY CHECKS

**MANDATORY CONSTRUCTION VERIFICATION**:

- ✅ **IMPERATIVE STRUCTURE** - All instructions formatted as direct action commands
- ✅ **SPECIFIC TARGETING** - Every command specifies exact action and criteria
- ✅ **SEQUENTIAL FLOW** - Commands chain logically without execution interruption
- ✅ **DECISION CLARITY** - Choice points formatted as immediate action triggers
- ✅ **QUALITY INTEGRATION** - Validation commands embedded throughout narrative
- ✅ **NAVIGATION SUPPORT** - Clear routing provided for all scenarios
- ✅ **COMPLETENESS COVERAGE** - All translation aspects addressed systematically

**⏱️ VALIDATION TIME**: 30 seconds for complete construction quality verification

### 🚀 NEXT EXECUTION ROUTING

**IMMEDIATE COMMAND DEPLOYMENT**: Upon construction completion, deploy commands through:

```
📋 STANDARD TRANSLATION → [Translation Commands](../command-guides/translation-commands.md)
🔧 TECHNICAL CONTENT → [Technical Translation](./technical-translation.md)
🧠 CONTEXT REQUIRED → [Context Integration](./context-integration.md)
🆘 COMPLEX ISSUES → [Translation Emergency](./translation-emergency.md)
```

**🎯 SUCCESS INDICATOR**: Command construction completion enables precise translation execution with systematic narrative clarity and user guidance integration.

## 🔄 FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION

**NARRATIVE STANDARD ALIGNMENT**: Command construction principles integrate with:
- **[Playbook Narrative Formatting](../../docs/principles/playbook-narrative-formatting.md)** - Framework-wide narrative consistency standards
- **[Translation Commands](../command-guides/translation-commands.md)** - Implementation of constructed command narratives
- **[Deep Analysis Principles](./deep-analysis-principles.md)** - Analysis command construction methodology

**⚡ CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY**: These principles govern all translation command creation to ensure execution clarity and systematic user guidance.
