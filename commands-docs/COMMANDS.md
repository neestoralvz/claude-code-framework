## Definition

**Commands** are self-contained execution environments that implement complete task workflows from initiation to validated completion. Each command encapsulates:
- **Complete workflow implementation** - From task analysis through final validation
- **Embedded principle application** - No external coordination required for framework compliance
- **Automatic agent deployment** - Intelligent specialist selection when advanced capabilities needed
- **Built-in quality assurance** - Four-gate validation system ensures completion standards

Commands serve as the primary interface between user requests and system capabilities, providing consistent execution patterns regardless of task complexity or domain specialization.
