## Deployment Examples

### Example 1: New Project Setup
```
Deploy the Testing Strategy Specialist agent to establish comprehensive testing framework for our Node.js microservices project. 

Mission: Create TDD/BDD integrated testing architecture with Jest optimization and automated coverage reporting.

Expected Deliverable: Complete testing configuration in work/[timestamp]-testing-strategy/ with implementation guidelines and quality gates.
```

### Example 2: Production Performance Issues
```
Deploy the Performance Optimization Specialist agent to analyze and resolve performance bottlenecks in our Express.js API.

Mission: Conduct systematic performance analysis, identify bottlenecks through profiling, and implement optimization strategies with measurable improvements.

Expected Deliverable: Performance analysis report and optimization implementation in work/[timestamp]-performance-optimization/ with before/after benchmarks.
```

### Example 3: API Design Implementation
```
Deploy the API Design Specialist agent to create RESTful API for user management system with comprehensive validation.

Mission: Design schema-driven API with validation middleware, security patterns, and comprehensive error handling following Node.js best practices.

Expected Deliverable: Complete API specification and implementation in work/[timestamp]-api-design/ with OpenAPI documentation and validation tests.
```

### Example 4: Code Quality Assessment
```
Deploy the Code Quality Specialist agent to review existing codebase and create quality improvement roadmap.

Mission: Analyze code against established patterns, validate TDD/BDD compliance, and provide evidence-based improvement recommendations with measurable success criteria.

Expected Deliverable: Quality assessment report and improvement plan in work/[timestamp]-code-quality-analysis/ with prioritized action items.
```
