# Parallel Coordination Strategy
*Session: 2025-08-20 06:34:56*

## Strategic Assessment

**Objective**: Simultaneous execution of agent optimization and medical agent creation for maximum efficiency.

### Independent Work Streams Identified:

**Stream A: Agent Model Audit & Optimization**
- Audit all existing agents for model assignments
- Identify optimization opportunities (upgrade to opus, downgrade to haiku)
- Implement model assignments systematically
- Update agent files with proper model specifications

**Stream B: Medical Agents Creation**
- Create medical-bibliography-verifier agent
- Create medical-literature-researcher agent  
- Create bibliography-link-tester agent
- Create medical-reference-consolidator agent
- Create presentation-bibliography-formatter agent

**Stream C: System Documentation & Standards**
- Document model selection criteria evidence-based
- Update agent creation workflow with optimization patterns
- Create reusable templates for future agent optimization
- Establish systematic agent review processes

### Dependencies Analysis:
- ✅ **Independent**: Medical agent creation doesn't depend on audit completion
- ✅ **Parallel Safe**: No file conflicts expected between streams
- ✅ **Resource Efficient**: Each stream can use specialized agents concurrently
- ✅ **Integration Ready**: All streams produce compatible deliverables

### Coordination Plan:
1. **This conversation**: Strategic coordination and decision making
2. **Parallel Stream A**: System-level agent optimization
3. **Parallel Stream B**: Medical domain agent creation  
4. **Parallel Stream C**: Documentation and standards establishment

**Integration Points**: 
- New medical agents will inherit optimized model selection patterns
- System standards will reflect both existing and new agent patterns
- All deliverables merge cleanly into unified agent ecosystem

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing agents have explicit model assignments
- Medical agents created with proper model specifications
- Documentation reflects evidence-based model selection
- No integration conflicts between parallel work streams
