# Pattern Integration Matrix (PIM) v4.0

_Meta-Orchestration Framework Component 2_

## Purpose

The Pattern Integration Matrix defines how ALL universal patterns coordinate, interact, and reinforce each other to create synergistic capability amplification across every interaction.

## Core Integration Architecture

### Primary Pattern Relationships

```yaml

  progressive_thinking:
    enables:
      - TodoWrite (structured task breakdown)
      - Agent Deployment (specialization identification)
      - Evidence Planning (validation strategy)
      - Parallelization (stream identification)
    requires:
      - Knowledge Loading (context awareness)
      - Pattern Recognition (historical reference)
    reinforces:
      - Quality Assurance (systematic approach)
      - Documentation (reasoning capture)
      
  todowrite:
    enables:
      - Parallel Execution (task independence)
      - Progress Tracking (status monitoring)
      - Evidence Collection (deliverable tracking)
    requires:

      - Atomic Breakdown (task decomposition)
    reinforces:
      - Agent Coordination (work distribution)
      - Quality Gates (checkpoint definition)
      
  agent_deployment:
    enables:
      - Specialization (expertise matching)
      - Parallelization (concurrent execution)
      - Verification (independent validation)
    requires:
      - Task Analysis (requirement identification)

- Context7 + Specialization = Expert implementation
- All Patterns Together = Maximum capability realization

**COORDINATION PROTOCOLS:**
- Handoff: Seamless pattern transitions
- Parallel: Concurrent pattern execution
- Feedback: Continuous pattern optimization
- Conflict: Automatic resolution with clear priorities

**NO PATTERN ISOLATION** - All patterns coordinate continuously
