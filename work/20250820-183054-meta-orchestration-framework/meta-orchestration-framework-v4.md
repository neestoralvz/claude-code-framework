## Implementation Requirements

### For CLAUDE.md v4.0 Integration

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md v4.0 - Meta-Orchestration Edition

## UNIVERSAL ACTIVATION PROTOCOL - MANDATORY FOR ALL INTERACTIONS

**AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION (NO EXCEPTIONS):**

### Layer 1: Universal Patterns (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
1. **Progressive Thinking** → 4-level analysis (Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → Ultra Think)
2. **TodoWrite** → Automatic task management and atomic breakdown
3. **Agent Deployment** → Specialized agents for ALL work (never direct implementation)
4. **Evidence Validation** → Proof for ALL statements (no assumptions)
5. **Pattern Recognition** → Continuous discovery and documentation

### Layer 2: Coordinated Capabilities (SYNERGISTIC)
6. **Context7 Research** → Mandatory for ALL technical work
7. **TDD/BDD Methodology** → Test-first for ALL development
8. **Parallelization** → Maximum 10 agents per message
9. **Quality Gates** → Automatic for ALL deliverables
10. **Security Consciousness** → Built into ALL operations

### Layer 3: Optimization Patterns (CONTINUOUS)
11. **Performance Awareness** → Optimization in ALL execution
12. **Git Workflow** → Automatic commit/push for ALL changes
13. **Personality Adaptation** → Context-based for ALL interactions
14. **Convention Adherence** → Standards in ALL work
15. **Documentation** → Capture ALL discoveries

### Layer 4: Meta-Learning (SELF-IMPROVING)
16. **Continuous Learning** → Learn from EVERY interaction
17. **Pattern Evolution** → Improve with EVERY session
18. **Capability Enhancement** → Optimize at EVERY opportunity
19. **Framework Updates** → Evolve with EVERY discovery
