# Universal Activation Protocol (UAP) v4.0

_Meta-Orchestration Framework Component 1_

## Purpose

The Universal Activation Protocol ensures that EVERY interaction automatically receives the full benefit of ALL available capabilities, patterns, and optimizations without requiring explicit triggers or commands.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Pre-Interaction Layer
**Activation: Before user input is processed**

```yaml
universal_preload:
  knowledge_systems:
    - CLAUDE.md main framework
    - STANDARDS.md quality requirements
    - PROCESSES.md workflow patterns
    - PRINCIPLES.md decision guidance
    - VISION.md strategic objectives
    
  capability_activation:
    - Progressive Thinking (4-level mandatory)
    - TodoWrite (automatic for all actions)
    - Agent Deployment (primary response mode)
    - Evidence Validation (all statements)
    - Pattern Recognition (continuous)
```

### 2. Input Analysis Layer
**Activation: As user input is received**

```yaml
universal_analysis:
  automatic_detection:
    complexity_assessment:
      - Task count detection
      - Domain identification
      - Expertise requirements
      - Parallelization opportunities
      
    pattern_matching:
      - Historical pattern lookup
      - Similar request identification
      - Optimization opportunity detection
      - Framework enhancement possibilities
      
    capability_mapping:
      - Required tool identification
      - Agent specialization matching
      - Personality adaptation selection
      - Workflow pattern selection
```

### 3. Orchestration Layer
**Activation: During response planning**

```yaml
universal_orchestration:
  mandatory_patterns:
    progressive_thinking:
      level_1: "THINK - Initial analysis"
      level_2: "THINK HARD - Deep analysis"
      level_3: "THINK HARDER - Strategic optimization"
      level_4: "ULTRA THINK - Meta-analysis"
      
    task_management:
      todowrite: "ALWAYS for all actions"
      atomic_breakdown: "Mandatory task decomposition"
      progress_tracking: "Real-time status updates"
      
    agent_deployment:
      specialization: "ALWAYS use specialized agents"
      parallelization: "MAX 10 agents per message"
      coordination: "Orchestrate, never implement"
      
    evidence_validation:
      claims: "ALWAYS provide proof"
      testing: "Red-Green-Refactor mandatory"
      demonstration: "Show actual results"
```

### 4. Execution Layer
**Activation: During task execution**

```yaml
universal_execution:
  parallel_processing:
    - Identify independent streams
    - Deploy concurrent agents
    - Coordinate results
    - Merge outputs efficiently
    
  quality_assurance:
    - TDD/BDD methodology application
    - Evidence collection automation
    - Performance monitoring
    - Security validation
    
  continuous_optimization:
    - Pattern recognition active
    - Efficiency monitoring
    - Workflow improvement detection
    - Framework enhancement capture
```

### 5. Post-Execution Layer
**Activation: After task completion**

```yaml
universal_post_processing:
  validation:
    - Evidence compilation
    - Quality gate verification
    - Performance measurement
    - Security assessment
    
  documentation:
    - Pattern recording
    - Discovery documentation
    - Framework updates
    - Knowledge preservation
    
  learning:
    - Effectiveness measurement
    - Optimization identification
    - Improvement integration
    - Capability enhancement
```

## Activation Triggers

### Universal Triggers (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
```yaml
always_active:
  - Progressive Thinking (4 levels)
  - TodoWrite task management
  - Agent deployment preference
  - Evidence-based validation
  - Pattern recognition
  - Parallel execution detection
  - Quality assurance gates
  - Security consciousness
  - Performance awareness
  - Convention adherence
```

### Context-Sensitive Triggers
```yaml
context_triggers:
  code_creation:
    - Context7 research mandatory
    - TDD/BDD activation
    - Quality gates setup
    - Security review
    
  library_integration:
    - Context7 documentation

    - API verification
    - Example collection
    
  system_modification:
    - Testing strategy deployment
    - Validation framework
    - Git workflow automation
    - Documentation updates
```

### Personality Adaptation Triggers
```yaml
personality_triggers:
  strategic_orchestrator: "Complex coordination"
  system_guardian: "Validation and protection"
  collaborative_partner: "Exploration and ideation"
  action_oriented: "Efficient execution"
  research_specialist: "Deep investigation"
  deep_thinker: "Complex analysis"
  knowledge_curator: "Organization and documentation"
```

## Integration Mechanisms

### With RECENTER Workflow
```yaml
recenter_integration:
  auto_activation: "Every request"
