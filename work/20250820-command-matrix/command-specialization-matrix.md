## Command Selection Patterns

### 1. Session Lifecycle Integration

#### Session Start → Work → Conclusion Flow
```yaml
optimal_session_flow:
  initiation:
    - assess_project_needs
    - if complex_project: "/project [name]"
    - if ongoing_work: "continue with existing context"
    
  execution:
    - monitor_complexity_levels
    - if overwhelmed: "/recenter [issue]"  
    - maintain_simple_easy_principles
    
  conclusion:
    - "/done [session-notes]"
    - automatic_framework_updates
    - transition_preparation
```

### 2. Complexity-Based Command Selection

#### Low Complexity Tasks (1-2)
```yaml
simple_tasks:
  session_management:
    - "/recenter" for quick refocus
    - "/done" for simple conclusion
  project_management:
    - "/project" only if formal documentation needed
```

#### Medium Complexity Tasks (3)  
```yaml
moderate_tasks:
  recommended_flow:
    - "/project" for structured planning
    - "/recenter" if complexity creep occurs
    - "/done" with comprehensive notes
```

#### High Complexity Tasks (4-5)
```yaml
complex_tasks:
  mandatory_flow:
    - "/project" for comprehensive planning
    - periodic "/recenter" to maintain focus
    - "/done" with full pattern extraction
```

### 3. Command Combination Patterns

#### Project Initiation Pattern
```yaml
new_project_workflow:
  step_1: "/project [project-name]"
  step_2: "execute project work with agent coordination"
  step_3: "/recenter" if complexity overwhelms
  step_4: "/done [project-completion-notes]"
  
  efficiency_benefits:
    - structured_planning_from_start
    - built_in_complexity_management
    - comprehensive_conclusion_capture
```

#### Crisis Management Pattern  
```yaml
complexity_crisis_workflow:
  immediate: "/recenter [specific-issue]"
  assessment: "evaluate if project documentation needed"
  optional: "/project" if comprehensive planning required
  conclusion: "/done [crisis-resolution-notes]"
  
  efficiency_benefits:
    - immediate_complexity_reduction
    - restored_focus_and_clarity
    - documented_resolution_approach
```

#### Session Optimization Pattern
```yaml
performance_optimization_workflow:
  regular_intervals: "/recenter" for maintaining simplicity
  complex_initiatives: "/project" for structured approach
  session_conclusions: "/done" for knowledge capture
  
  efficiency_benefits:
    - sustained_performance_levels
    - prevented_complexity_accumulation
    - continuous_framework_improvement
```

## Command Integration with Agent Matrix

### 1. Command → Agent Coordination

#### `/project` Command + Agent Deployment
```yaml
project_command_agents:
  research_phase:
    - general_purpose: "market and technical research"
    - medical_literature_researcher: "if medical domain project"
    
  planning_phase:
    - documentation_curator: "structure and organize project docs"
    - system_enhancement_specialist: "optimize workflow integration"
    
  execution_phase:
    - domain_specific_agents: "based on project requirements"
    - testing_specialist: "validation and quality assurance"
```

#### `/recenter` Command + Agent Coordination
```yaml
recenter_command_agents:
  complexity_analysis:
    - system_enhancement_specialist: "workflow optimization"
    - documentation_curator: "simplify and clarify documentation"
    
  solution_simplification:
    - general_purpose: "research simpler approaches"
    - code_quality_specialist: "identify over-engineering"
```

#### `/done` Command + Agent Deployment
```yaml
done_command_agents:
  knowledge_capture:
    - documentation_curator: "organize and structure learnings"
    - system_enhancement_specialist: "integrate improvements"
    
  pattern_extraction:
    - general_purpose: "research and validate patterns"
    - agent_template_architect: "optimize agent configurations"
```

### 2. Agent-Informed Command Selection

#### When Agents Suggest Command Usage
```yaml
agent_command_recommendations:
  from_general_purpose:
    - complex_research → "/project" for structured approach
    - scattered_findings → "/recenter" for focus restoration
    
  from_system_enhancement_specialist:
    - workflow_improvements_found → "/done" to capture patterns
    - complexity_creep_detected → "/recenter" for simplification
    
  from_documentation_curator:
    - comprehensive_docs_needed → "/project" for structure
    - documentation_overwhelm → "/recenter" for clarity
```

## Decision Tree for Command Selection

```
Command Selection Analysis
├── Task Assessment
│   ├── New Project/Initiative → "/project [name]"
│   ├── Complexity Overwhelm → "/recenter [issue]"  
│   └── Session Completion → "/done [notes]"
│
├── Session Phase
│   ├── Initiation → Consider "/project" for complex work
│   ├── Execution → Monitor need for "/recenter"
│   └── Conclusion → Always "/done"
│
└── Complexity Level
    ├── Level 1-2 → Commands optional except "/done"
    ├── Level 3 → "/project" recommended, "/recenter" as needed
    └── Level 4-5 → All commands mandatory in workflow
```
