*Generated: 2025-08-20 23:55:00*

## MISSION
Create comprehensive testing suite that validates ERROR ATTENTION PROTOCOL hooks work flawlessly across all scenarios with 100% reliability.

## TESTING FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE

### Core Testing Components
- **error-detection-tests/** - Validates hook error detection capabilities
- **framework-compliance-tests/** - Tests Universal Operation enforcement  
- **edge-case-tests/** - Stress tests hook reliability under extreme conditions
- **system-integration-tests/** - Validates seamless operation with existing systems
- **performance-benchmarks/** - Measures hook execution performance and efficiency

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **100% Error Detection Coverage** - All framework violations must be caught
- **100% Response Coverage** - All error responses must be tested
- **100% Edge Case Coverage** - All failure modes must be validated
- **100% Integration Coverage** - All system interactions must be verified

### Evidence Validation Standards
- All test results must be measurable and verifiable
- Performance benchmarks must include specific timing metrics
- Edge case testing must demonstrate proper failure recovery
- Integration testing must prove zero system conflicts

### Quality Assurance Protocol
- TDD/BDD methodology mandatory for all test development
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all test implementations
- Evidence-based validation for all reliability claims
- Git integration for all test result tracking
