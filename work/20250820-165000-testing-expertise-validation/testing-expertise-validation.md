## Testing Strategy Implementation Patterns

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
```javascript
// Red Phase: Failing Test
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  it('should authenticate valid users', () => {
    // Test fails initially - Red phase
  });
});

// Green Phase: Minimal Implementation
// Just enough code to pass the test

// Refactor Phase: Quality Improvement
// Improve design while maintaining passing tests
```

### Given-When-Then Scenarios
```gherkin
Given a user with valid credentials
When the user attempts to log in
Then the user should be authenticated successfully
And the session should be established
```

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Acceptance tests validate BDD scenarios
- [ ] Manual verification confirms behavior
- [ ] Documentation shows evidence
- [ ] Coverage meets quality gates (80%+ for new code)

### Evidence Requirements
Every testing implementation must provide:
