## üîÑ TDD/BDD Implementation Examples

### Test-Driven Development (Red-Green-Refactor)

```javascript
// RED: Write failing test first
it('should authenticate users with valid credentials', () => {
  const result = authService.authenticateUser('testuser', 'testpassword');
  expect(result.success).toBe(true);
});

// GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass
authenticateUser(username, password) {
  // Minimal implementation
  return { success: true };
}

// REFACTOR: Improve design while maintaining tests
authenticateUser(username, password) {
  const user = this.users.get(username);
  if (!user || user.password !== password) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Invalid credentials' };
  }
  // Complete implementation with session management
}
```

### Behavior-Driven Development (Given-When-Then)

```javascript
describe('User Authentication Behavior', () => {
  it('should authenticate users with valid credentials', () => {
    // Given: A registered user with valid credentials
    const username = 'testuser';
    const password = 'testpassword';

    // When: The user attempts to authenticate
    const result = authService.authenticateUser(username, password);

    // Then: The authentication should succeed
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.sessionId).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

## üìä Coverage and Quality Metrics

### Coverage Configuration
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    branches: 80,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80
  }
}
```

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Test Coverage**: 80%+ for all new code
- **Integration Test Coverage**: Complete workflow validation
- **BDD Scenario Coverage**: All features have Given-When-Then scenarios
- **Performance Standards**: Sub-second execution for standard operations

## üöÄ Testing Commands

### Development Workflow
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch          # TDD development mode
npm run test:coverage       # Generate coverage reports
npm run test:ci             # CI/CD pipeline execution
```

### Specialized Testing
```bash
npm run test:unit           # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests only
npm run test:bdd            # BDD scenarios only
npm run test:performance    # Performance validation
```

### Quality Assurance
```bash
npm run lint                # Code quality validation
npm run validate            # Complete quality check
npm run coverage:open       # View coverage reports
```

## üé≠ Agent Coordination Examples

The testing specialists can coordinate with other agents:

```markdown
# Multi-Agent Testing Strategy
1. **Testing Strategy Specialist**: Design comprehensive architecture
2. **Security Validator**: Implement security testing patterns
3. **Performance Optimizer**: Create performance benchmarks
4. **Documentation Curator**: Generate testing documentation
```

## üìà Evidence-Based Validation
