# Agent Deployment Integration Plan

## Overview
Systematic update of 48 workflow files to integrate mandatory agent deployment patterns consistent with CLAUDE.md framework requirements.

## Core Principle
**ALL actions must deploy specialized agents BEFORE attempting direct work**

## Pattern Transformations

### Direct Implementation â†’ Agent Deployment

| Current Pattern | Transform To | Agent Type |
|----------------|--------------|------------|
| "Implement X" | "Deploy implementation-specialist to implement X" | implementation-specialist |
| "Create Y" | "Deploy creation-specialist to create Y" | creation-specialist |
| "Analyze Z" | "Deploy analysis-specialist to analyze Z" | analysis-specialist |
| "Test A" | "Deploy testing-strategy-specialist to test A" | testing-strategy-specialist |
| "Debug B" | "Deploy debugging-specialist to debug B" | debugging-specialist |
| "Validate C" | "Deploy validation-specialist to validate C" | validation-specialist |
| "Research D" | "Deploy research-specialist to research D" | research-specialist |
| "Document E" | "Deploy documentation-specialist to document E" | documentation-specialist |
| "Optimize F" | "Deploy optimization-specialist to optimize F" | optimization-specialist |
| "Review G" | "Deploy review-specialist to review G" | review-specialist |

## Update Strategy

### Phase 1: Pattern Analysis
1. Identify all direct implementation steps
2. Map to appropriate specialist agents
3. Document transformation patterns

### Phase 2: Systematic Updates
1. Update each workflow group systematically
2. Maintain consistency across similar workflows
3. Preserve existing quality standards

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Verify all workflows follow agent-first approach
2. Ensure no direct implementation remains
3. Validate agent selection guidance

## Agent Selection Matrix

| Task Domain | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Parallel Options |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Testing | testing-strategy-specialist | validation-specialist | debugging-specialist |
| Development | implementation-specialist | code-quality-specialist | optimization-specialist |
| Research | research-specialist | documentation-specialist | analysis-specialist |
| Planning | strategic-orchestrator | project-management-specialist | metrics-specialist |
| Analysis | analysis-specialist | root-cause-specialist | pattern-recognition-specialist |
| Documentation | documentation-specialist | knowledge-curator | technical-writer |

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate**: Update critical workflows (TDD/BDD, Development, Validation)
2. **Next**: Update research and strategic workflows
3. **Then**: Update thinking and problem-solving workflows
4. **Finally**: Update management and auxiliary workflows

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 38 workflows updated with agent deployment patterns
- [ ] No direct implementation steps remain
- [ ] Consistent agent selection guidance provided
- [ ] Framework integrity maintained
- [ ] Validation patterns preserved
- [ ] Quality standards upheld
