## Key Patterns Applied

### Agent Deployment Pattern
```markdown
**Deploy [specialist-type]** to [action]:

**Agent Instructions**: "[Specific instructions for the agent including:
- What to analyze/implement/validate
- Specific steps to follow
- Expected deliverables
- Success criteria]"
```

### Validation Pattern
```markdown
**Validation**: Deploy validation-specialist to [verify specific outcome]
```

### Coordination Pattern
```markdown
**Deploy strategic-orchestrator** to coordinate multiple specialists:
- Deploy [specialist-1] for [task-1]
- Deploy [specialist-2] for [task-2]
- Coordinate results and dependencies
```

## Success Metrics
- ✅ 12 workflows updated with agent deployment
- ✅ Consistent pattern application
- ✅ Clear agent instructions provided
- ✅ Validation requirements maintained
- ⏳ 36 workflows remaining for update

## Next Steps
1. Continue systematic updates of remaining workflows
2. Validate consistency across all files
3. Test agent deployment patterns
4. Create validation checklist
