  I want the integration matrix to correctly specify pattern activation
  So that optimal pattern combinations are used

  I want conflicts between patterns to be resolved gracefully
  So that optimal execution is maintained

  Scenario: TodoWrite vs Progressive Thinking priority
    Given both TodoWrite and Progressive Thinking are triggered
    When processing a complex multi-step task
    Then TodoWrite should create task structure
    And Progressive Thinking should operate within tasks
    And no conflicts should occur

  Scenario: Parallel vs Sequential execution conflict
    Given tasks have mixed dependencies
    When parallel execution is detected
    Then dependency analysis should resolve conflicts
    And optimal execution order should be determined
    And both parallel and sequential elements should coexist

  Scenario: Multiple personality triggers
    Given both Strategic Orchestrator and Deep Thinker are triggered
    When context requires both planning and analysis
    Then primary personality should be selected based on dominant need
    And secondary behaviors should be incorporated
    And personality switching should be smooth
```

## Alertness Level Progression Validation

```gherkin

  As a system optimizer
  I want alertness levels to progress based on complexity
  So that appropriate optimization intensity is applied

  Scenario: Level 1 Basic Alertness activation
    Given I have a straightforward multi-step task
    When the perpetual alertness system evaluates complexity
    Then Level 1 Basic Alertness should activate
    And TodoWrite should be enabled
    And Progressive Thinking should be available for complexity
    And basic agent deployment should be ready

  Scenario: Level 2 Enhanced Alertness activation

    And proactive framework enhancement should operate
```

## Continuous Monitoring Validation

```gherkin

  I want monitoring to catch missed opportunities
  So that optimal execution is maintained throughout

  Scenario: Missed TodoWrite opportunity detection
    Given work proceeds without TodoWrite activation
    When monitoring detects multi-step complexity
    Then missed opportunity should be flagged
    And TodoWrite should be activated retroactively
    And task organization should be applied

  Scenario: Unoptimized serial execution detection
    Given tasks are running sequentially
    When monitoring detects parallelization potential
    Then optimization opportunity should be identified
    And parallel execution should be recommended
    And efficiency improvement should be measured

  Scenario: Pattern discovery monitoring
    Given new optimization patterns emerge during work
    When monitoring detects workflow improvements
    Then new patterns should be documented

    And system evolution should be tracked
```

## Performance Impact Validation

### Overhead Measurement Tests

```gherkin
Feature: Overhead Measurement
  As a performance analyst
  I want to measure alertness system overhead
  So that benefits exceed costs

  Scenario: Pattern detection overhead measurement
    Given baseline execution without perpetual alertness
    When measuring execution with all patterns active
    Then overhead should be less than 5% of total execution time
    And pattern detection should complete within 100ms
    And memory usage should increase by less than 10%

  Scenario: Integration matrix lookup performance
    Given 104 integration points in the matrix
    When performing matrix lookups for pattern coordination
    Then lookup time should be less than 10ms per query
    And matrix traversal should be O(1) complexity
    And caching should optimize repeated lookups
```

### Efficiency Gain Measurement Tests

```gherkin
Feature: Efficiency Gain Measurement
  As a system evaluator
  I want to measure efficiency improvements
  So that system value is quantifiable

  Scenario: Parallel execution time savings
    Given work that can be parallelized
    When comparing sequential vs parallel execution
    Then time savings should be measurable
    And efficiency gain should exceed 20%
    And quality should remain constant

  Scenario: Early error detection savings
    Given work that could fail late without TDD
    When TDD methodology catches errors early
    Then rework time should be reduced by 50%+
    And overall quality should improve
    And debugging time should decrease significantly
```

## Edge Case Scenario Validation

### Multiple Pattern Simultaneous Activation

```gherkin
Feature: Multiple Pattern Simultaneous Activation
  As a stress tester
  I want all patterns to potentially activate simultaneously
  So that system stability under maximum load is verified

  Scenario: All 13 patterns activate simultaneously
    Given a complex code implementation task with research, planning, security, and performance requirements
    When the perpetual alertness system processes maximum complexity
    Then all 13 patterns should activate without conflicts
    And resource usage should remain within acceptable limits
    And execution should proceed efficiently
    And no pattern should interfere with others

  Scenario: Rapid pattern switching
    Given work context changes rapidly between different domains
    When patterns need to activate and deactivate quickly
    Then pattern switching should be smooth
    And no state corruption should occur
    And context should be preserved across switches
```

### Failure and Recovery Scenarios

```gherkin
Feature: Failure and Recovery Scenarios
  As a reliability tester
  I want the system to handle failures gracefully
  So that robustness is ensured

  Scenario: Pattern activation failure handling
    Given a pattern fails to activate due to resource constraints
    When the perpetual alertness system detects the failure
    Then fallback mechanisms should engage
    And alternative patterns should be considered
    And execution should continue with degraded capabilities
    And failure should be logged for analysis

  Scenario: Integration matrix corruption handling
    Given the integration matrix becomes corrupted
    When pattern coordination is needed
    Then safe defaults should be used
    And maximum alertness should be assumed
    And system should remain functional
    And corruption should be detected and reported
