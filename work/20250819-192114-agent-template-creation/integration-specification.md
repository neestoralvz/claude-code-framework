# Agent Integration Specification

## Framework Integration Overview

This specification defines how agents integrate with our orchestration framework, ensuring seamless operation while maintaining evidence-based validation and efficient cognitive load management.

## Core Integration Points

### 1. CLAUDE.md Framework Alignment

#### Simple and Easy Framework Compliance
```yaml
# Agent must implement these principles:
- Keep it simple: Clear, unambiguous instructions
- Make it easy: Immediate usability without interpretation
- Evidence-based: Verifiable, measurable outcomes
- Orchestration-first: Deploy specialists rather than execute directly
```

#### Orchestrator Role Integration
Agents must support the orchestrator pattern:
- **Ultra-specific task definition**: Clear, bounded scope
- **Direct file references**: Specific sections and line numbers
- **Operations folder usage**: Timestamped subfolders for intermediate work
- **Standards-expert delivery**: Final deliverables by appropriate specialists
- **Restart protocols**: 100% compliance requirement

#### Cognitive Load Efficiency
- **Specialized deployment**: Domain experts for specific tasks
- **Evidence collection**: Transparent, verifiable criteria
- **Quality gates**: Systematic validation checkpoints
- **Maintenance protocols**: Sustainable long-term operation

### 2. System Standards Integration

#### File Organization Standards
```bash
# Agent file placement follows category structure:
agents/
├── core-system/           # System integrity agents
├── development/          # Development specialists
│   ├── architecture/    # System architects
│   ├── backend/         # Backend specialists
│   └── quality/         # Quality assurance
├── work/          # Operations specialists
│   ├── cloud/          # Cloud platform experts
│   ├── infrastructure/ # Infrastructure specialists
│   └── orchestration/  # Container/orchestration
├── database/           # Database specialists
└── research/           # Research specialists
```

#### Content Standards Alignment
- **Conversational writing**: Clear, direct communication
- **Markdown formatting**: Consistent structure and presentation
- **Link file standards**: Proper cross-referencing
- **Clean content**: Focus on information, minimal navigation

#### Technical Standards Integration
- **Type safe interfaces**: Clear parameter definitions
- **Workflow organization**: Structured, maintainable processes
- **Tool integration patterns**: Consistent tool usage

### 3. Process Framework Integration

#### Complete Workflow Alignment
Agents must integrate with the four-phase workflow:
1. **Explore**: Analysis and discovery phase
2. **Execute**: Implementation and delivery phase
3. **Validate**: Quality assurance and verification phase
4. **Maintain**: Ongoing maintenance and optimization phase

#### Thinking Process Integration
Agents should leverage appropriate thinking processes:
- **Think**: Basic analysis for straightforward tasks
- **Think Hard**: Complex problem analysis
- **Progressive Thinking**: Multi-step task breakdown
- **Ultra Think**: Fundamental system changes

#### Error Handling Integration
- **Systematic error detection**: Built-in validation protocols
- **Recovery procedures**: Clear restart and rollback options
- **Quality preservation**: Maintain system integrity during failures
- **Evidence collection**: Document all validation activities

## Registry Integration Specification

### Agent Registry Structure
```json
{
  "agent-id": {
    "id": "unique-identifier",
    "name": "Human Readable Name",
    "location": "agents/category/agent-file.md",
    "category": "category-name",
    "specialization": "Brief specialization description",
    "capabilities": [
      "specific-capability-1",
      "specific-capability-2",
      "specific-capability-3"
    ],
    "status": "active|inactive|deprecated",
    "deployment_info": {
      "subagent_type": "agent-id",
      "tools": ["Tool1", "Tool2", "Tool3"]
    },
    "metadata": {
      "expertise_level": "doctorate",
      "domain": "domain-name",
      "created": "YYYY-MM-DD"
    }
  }
}
```

### Category Management
Categories must be defined in the registry with:
- **Description**: Clear scope and purpose
- **Agent list**: All agents in the category
- **Coordination rules**: How agents interact within category

### Statistics Tracking
Registry maintains:
- **Total agents**: Aggregate count
- **By category**: Category-specific counts
- **By status**: Active/inactive/deprecated counts

## Operations Integration

### Directory Structure Requirements
```bash
# All agent work uses timestamped operations directories:
work/
└── YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-agent-[domain]/
    ├── analysis-results.md
    ├── implementation-log.md
    ├── validation-evidence.md
    └── deliverables/
```

### Quality Gate Integration
Agents must implement four-gate validation:
1. **Requirements Gate**: Clear, verifiable requirements
2. **Design Gate**: Evidence-based design decisions
3. **Implementation Gate**: Quality implementation with validation
4. **Delivery Gate**: Complete deliverables with evidence

### Evidence Collection Requirements
All agent operations must produce:
- **Decision documentation**: Why specific approaches were chosen
- **Validation evidence**: Proof that requirements were met
- **Quality metrics**: Measurable improvement indicators
- **Integration proof**: Demonstration of framework compatibility

## Tool Integration Patterns

### Standard Tool Groups
```yaml
# Analysis tools for discovery and examination
analysis_tools: [Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, TodoWrite]

# Creation tools for implementation and delivery
creation_tools: [Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, TodoWrite]

# Research tools for information gathering
research_tools: [WebFetch, WebSearch, Read, TodoWrite]

# System tools for operations and automation
system_tools: [Bash, BashOutput, KillBash, Grep, LS, Read]

# Full capability for complex agents
full_tools: [All available tools]
```

### Tool Selection Guidelines
- **Principle of least privilege**: Only include necessary tools
- **Capability matching**: Tools must match agent responsibilities
- **Integration testing**: Verify all tools work correctly
- **Documentation**: Document tool usage patterns

## Validation Framework Integration

### Agent Validation Requirements
Every agent must:
1. **Define success criteria**: Evidence-based, measurable outcomes
2. **Implement restart protocols**: 100% compliance requirement
3. **Provide validation checkpoints**: Systematic quality gates
4. **Document evidence collection**: Transparent verification process

### Framework Compatibility Testing
Before deployment, verify:
- **Orchestration compatibility**: Works with existing framework
- **Tool availability**: All specified tools are accessible
- **Quality integration**: Meets validation framework requirements
- **Evidence production**: Generates required documentation

### Ongoing Validation Maintenance
- **Performance monitoring**: Track agent effectiveness
- **Quality metrics**: Measure improvement indicators
- **Integration health**: Ensure continued compatibility
- **Evolution support**: Adapt to framework changes

## Orchestration Protocol Integration

### Agent Deployment Pattern
```yaml
# Standard deployment sequence:
1. Requirement Analysis: Clear, specific task definition
2. Agent Selection: Choose appropriate specialist
3. Context Provision: Provide direct file references
4. Task Execution: Agent performs specialized work
5. Evidence Collection: Gather validation documentation
6. Quality Validation: Verify compliance with standards
7. Integration Verification: Ensure framework compatibility
8. Delivery Confirmation: Complete deliverable handoff
```
