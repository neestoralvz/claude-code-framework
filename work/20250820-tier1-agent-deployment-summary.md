## Integration Patterns

### Cross-Agent Collaboration Workflows

**Full-Stack Application Development:**
```
requirements-analysis-specialist → Gather and document requirements
    ↓
database-design-specialist → Design data architecture
    ↓
frontend-architecture-specialist → Design UI architecture
    ↓
infrastructure-automation-specialist → Provision infrastructure
    ↓
api-design-specialist (existing) → Design API contracts
    ↓
testing-strategy-specialist (existing) → Implement testing
```

**Performance Optimization Workflow:**
```
database-design-specialist → Optimize queries and indexes
    +
frontend-architecture-specialist → Optimize bundle sizes
    +
infrastructure-automation-specialist → Scale infrastructure
    ↓
performance-optimization-specialist (existing) → Validate improvements
```

## Validation Criteria

### Database Design Specialist
- ✓ DDL scripts execute without errors
- ✓ Query performance improves by measurable percentage
- ✓ Migration scripts include successful rollback tests
- ✓ Referential integrity maintained across all operations

### Frontend Architecture Specialist
- ✓ Lighthouse scores meet performance budgets
- ✓ Bundle sizes reduced from baseline measurements
- ✓ WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance achieved
- ✓ Component tests achieve >80% coverage

### Infrastructure Automation Specialist
- ✓ Infrastructure provisions successfully from IaC
- ✓ Deployment success rate >99%
- ✓ Auto-scaling responds within defined thresholds
- ✓ Disaster recovery RTO/RPO requirements met

### Requirements Analysis Specialist
- ✓ All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- ✓ Stakeholder sign-off obtained for specifications
- ✓ Requirements trace to business objectives
- ✓ User stories follow INVEST principles

## Evidence-Based Design Principles Applied

1. **Single Domain Focus**: Each agent has laser-focused expertise without overlap
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit scope definitions of what they do/don't do
3. **Measurable Outputs**: Specific deliverables with validation criteria
4. **Integration Points**: Defined touchpoints with other agents
5. **Quality Gates**: Success criteria and evidence requirements

## Workflow Decision Matrix Integration

These agents fill critical gaps identified in the workflow decision matrix:

- **Database Operations**: Previously no specialized agent for schema design
- **Frontend Development**: Lacked dedicated frontend architecture expertise
- **Infrastructure Management**: Missing IaC and deployment automation specialist
- **Requirements Management**: No dedicated business analysis capability

## Usage Examples

### Deploy Database Design Specialist:
```
Task: "Deploy database-design-specialist to design a PostgreSQL schema for an e-commerce platform with inventory management, order processing, and user accounts. Include indexing strategies and migration scripts."
```

### Deploy Frontend Architecture Specialist:
```
Task: "Deploy frontend-architecture-specialist to architect a React application with Redux state management, implement code splitting for performance, and ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance."
```

### Deploy Infrastructure Automation Specialist:
```
Task: "Deploy infrastructure-automation-specialist to create Terraform templates for AWS infrastructure with EKS cluster, RDS instances, and CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions."
```

### Deploy Requirements Analysis Specialist:
```
Task: "Deploy requirements-analysis-specialist to gather and document requirements for a customer portal, create user stories with acceptance criteria, and establish requirement priorities."
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test Agent Deployment**: Validate each agent works with Task tool
2. **Update Workflow Matrix**: Include new agents in decision logic
3. **Create Tier 2 Agents**: Continue with next priority agents
4. **Document Integration Patterns**: Expand multi-agent coordination examples
5. **Measure Effectiveness**: Track agent usage and success rates
