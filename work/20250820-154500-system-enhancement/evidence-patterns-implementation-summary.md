- Quality gate enforcement levels (BLOCKING, WARNING, ADVISORY)
- Red-Green-Refactor quality validation patterns
- Evidence threshold monitoring and reporting

### 5. Workflow Integration Patterns
**File**: `/Users/nalve/.claude/system/standards/evidence-workflow-integration.md`
**Purpose**: Seamless integration with existing TDD/BDD workflows
**Features**:
- TDD/BDD unified workflow evidence integration
- Specialized workflow integration (Progressive Thinking, QA, Web Research)
- Tool integration specifications (IDE, CI/CD, testing frameworks)
- Evidence storage and retrieval integration
- Dashboard and reporting integration
- Integration health monitoring
- Migration and adoption strategy

## Key Integration Points
