## Evidence Requirements Compliance

All agents follow the framework's evidence-based validation requirements:

### Security Evidence
- Static analysis scan results
- Vulnerability test results with proof-of-concept
- Security checklist compliance
- Penetration test findings

### Monitoring Evidence
- Dashboard screenshots
- Alert history with effectiveness metrics
- Trace examples showing bottlenecks
- Log queries solving issues

### Load Testing Evidence
- Test execution logs with timestamps
- Response time percentiles
- Throughput graphs
- Resource utilization charts

### Documentation Evidence
- Coverage metrics
- Readability scores
- User feedback ratings
- Cross-reference integrity

## TDD/BDD Workflow Integration

Each agent integrates with the framework's testing methodologies:

1. **Security**: TDD Security Workflow with failing security tests first
2. **Monitoring**: Evidence-based validation with real metrics
3. **Load Testing**: Red-Green-Refactor for performance requirements
4. **Documentation**: Validation workflow ensuring accuracy

## Deployment Validation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Validation script for Tier 2 agents

echo "Validating Tier 2 Agent Deployment..."

# Check agent files exist
agents=(
    "agents/security/application-security-specialist.md"
    "agents/operations/monitoring-observability-specialist.md"
    "agents/testing/load-testing-specialist.md"
    "agents/documentation/technical-writing-specialist.md"
)

for agent in "${agents[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "/Users/nalve/.claude/$agent" ]; then
        echo "✓ $agent exists"
        
        # Validate YAML frontmatter
        if head -n 1 "/Users/nalve/.claude/$agent" | grep -q "^---$"; then
            echo "  ✓ Valid YAML frontmatter"
        else
            echo "  ✗ Invalid YAML frontmatter"
        fi
    else
        echo "✗ $agent missing"
    fi
done

echo "Validation complete!"
```
