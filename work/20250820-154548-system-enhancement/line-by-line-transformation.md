_Precise transformation instructions for universal behavior activation_

## HIGH PRIORITY TRANSFORMATIONS (Immediate Impact)

### Lines 13-23: Core Rules
**CURRENT PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS**:
```markdown
Line 13: **IF starting work** → Keep it simple. Make it easy.
Line 15: **IF uncertain about anything** → STOP. Get clarification. No assumptions.
Line 17: **IF user makes request** → Understand what they need. Deliver results. Done.
Line 19: **IF getting lost or overwhelmed** → READ [core/CORE.md]
Line 21: **IF things are getting too complex** → STOP. Return to Simple and Easy
Line 23: **IF losing sight of purpose** → Remember: Framework exists...
```

**UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENTS**:
```markdown
Line 13: **FOR ALL work** → Simple and Easy active. Progressive Thinking engaged. Agents deployed.
Line 15: **FOR ALL uncertainties** → Research agents auto-deploy. WebSearch/Context7 active. Zero assumptions.
Line 17: **FOR ALL requests** → Progressive analysis → Agent orchestration → Parallel execution → Validated delivery.
Line 19: **CONTINUOUS CENTERING** → [core/CORE.md] principles active in background
Line 21: **COMPLEXITY MONITOR** → Auto-simplification triggers when complexity detected
Line 23: **PURPOSE ALIGNMENT** → Framework optimization continuous for maximum performance
```

### Lines 97-121: Work Commands 
**CURRENT PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS**:
```markdown
Line 97: **IF task has 2+ steps** → Use TodoWrite immediately
Line 99: **IF problem is complex** → Use Progressive Thinking
Line 101: **IF need library docs** → Use Context7
Line 103: **IF creating scripts/hooks/code** → ALWAYS use Context7 first
Line 107: **IF need current info** → Use WebSearch with year 2025
```

**UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENTS**:
```markdown
Line 97: **FOR ALL tasks** → TodoWrite active with atomic breakdown (no step threshold)
Line 99: **FOR ALL problems** → Progressive Thinking decomposition running continuously
Line 101: **FOR ALL technical references** → Context7 baseline research before any action
Line 103: **FOR ALL code creation** → Context7 → Specialized agent → TDD validation (mandatory)
Line 107: **FOR ALL information needs** → WebSearch (2025) → WebFetch pipeline active
```

### Lines 143-167: Validation Requirements
**CURRENT PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS**:
```markdown
Line 143: **IF improvising** → Stop. Check my documentation first
Line 145: **IF making changes** → Follow TDD/BDD Unified Workflow
Line 147: **IF doing ANY action** → Must follow Validation and Demonstration
Line 153: **IF user requests new behavior** → Document in CLAUDE.md
Line 157: **IF testing hooks/scripts** → Must test with exact same input
```

**UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENTS**:
```markdown
Line 143: **NO IMPROVISATION** → Documentation check mandatory before all actions
Line 145: **FOR ALL changes** → TDD/BDD workflow with Red-Green-Refactor (no exceptions)
Line 147: **FOR ALL actions** → Validation and Demonstration required with evidence
Line 153: **FOR ALL new behaviors** → Auto-document in CLAUDE.md immediately
Line 157: **FOR ALL testing** → Production-identical environment mandatory
```

### Lines 169-191: Evidence and Claims
**CURRENT PROBLEMATIC PATTERNS**:
```markdown
Line 169: **IF making ANY claim** → Must provide evidence
Line 171: **IF stating something works** → Must demonstrate with actual test results
Line 173: **IF claiming to know something** → Must verify with WebSearch/WebFetch
Line 175: **IF providing metrics or facts** → Must use real measurements
Line 177: **IF uncertain about ANYTHING** → Use scripts, external validation
```

**UNIVERSAL REPLACEMENTS**:
```markdown
Line 169: **FOR ALL statements** → Evidence-based validation with proof
Line 171: **FOR ALL functionality claims** → Working demonstration required
Line 173: **FOR ALL knowledge claims** → WebSearch/Context7 verification mandatory
Line 175: **FOR ALL metrics** → Real measurements only (no estimates)

## IMPLEMENTATION SCRIPT

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Transform CLAUDE.md from conditional to universal behaviors"""

import re
from pathlib import Path

def transform_conditionals(content):
    """Replace IF conditions with universal triggers"""
    
    # Core transformations
    replacements = [
        # Core Rules
        (r'\*\*IF starting work\*\* →.*', 
         '**FOR ALL work** → Simple and Easy active. Progressive Thinking engaged. Agents deployed.'),
        (r'\*\*IF uncertain about anything\*\* →.*',

        # Add more transformations as needed...
    ]
    
    for pattern, replacement in replacements:
        content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    return content

if __name__ == '__main__':
    claude_md = Path('CLAUDE.md')
    backup = Path(f'CLAUDE.md.backup.{datetime.now():%Y%m%d}')
    
    # Backup
    content = claude_md.read_text()
    backup.write_text(content)
    
    # Transform
    transformed = transform_conditionals(content)
    
    # Write
    claude_md.write_text(transformed)
    print(f"Transformed {len(replacements)} conditional patterns to universal behaviors")
```

## VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Success Indicators
1. **No IF statements** for core operations
2. **All capabilities** active by default
3. **Automatic triggers** for all optimizations
4. **Continuous monitoring** vs event-based
5. **Proactive operation** vs reactive

### Failure Indicators
1. Conditional logic remains in critical paths
2. User must trigger optimizations
3. Capabilities dormant until activated
4. Inconsistent behavior across sessions
5. Optimization opportunities missed

## ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If issues arise:
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp CLAUDE.md.backup.20250820 CLAUDE.md
git add CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Rollback: Restore conditional behaviors pending refinement"
git push
```

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**IMPLEMENT IN PHASES**:
1. **Phase 1** (Immediate): Transform Core Rules + Work Commands
2. **Phase 2** (Day 2): Transform Validation + Agent requirements
3. **Phase 3** (Week 1): Transform Personalities + Sessions
4. **Phase 4** (Week 2): Transform remaining conditionals

**SUCCESS METRIC**: 0 IF statements in critical execution paths by end of Phase 2.
