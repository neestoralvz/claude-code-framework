   - Complete monitoring framework documentation
   - Simple access patterns
   - Automated response workflows
   - Integration points with v5.0 tools

2. **Monitoring Agent Templates** (`monitoring-agents.md`)
   - 5 specialized monitoring agents:
     - system-monitor (health & performance)
     - quality-monitor (standards compliance)
     - performance-monitor (speed optimization)
     - alert-monitor (issue management)
     - dashboard-generator (visualization)

3. **Example Workflow** (`example-monitoring-workflow.md`)
   - Demonstrates seamless integration
   - Shows monitoring during all workflow phases
   - Includes issue handling examples
   - Provides best practices

4. **Integration Test** (`test-monitoring-integration.sh`)
   - Validates all components
   - Confirms simplicity maintained
   - Verifies completeness

### 3. Key Features Delivered

#### Simple Interface
- **One Command Access**: `/monitor` for instant status
- **Progressive Detail**: Simple view by default, detailed on request
- **Automatic Operation**: Monitoring runs without user intervention

#### Powerful Capabilities
- **Real-time Tracking**: Agent performance, task progress, system health
- **Automated Response**: Issues detected and addressed automatically
- **Quality Assurance**: Framework compliance validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous efficiency improvements
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data and pattern recognition

#### Seamless Integration
- **Workflow Alignment**: Fits perfectly with "Think ‚Üí Deploy Agent ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Done"
- **Tool Integration**: Works with TodoWrite, Task, Context7, Git
- **Agent Coordination**: Monitors agent deployment and performance
- **Error Prevention**: Proactive issue detection and resolution

## Usage Guide
