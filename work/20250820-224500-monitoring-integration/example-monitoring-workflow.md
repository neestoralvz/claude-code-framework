# Example Monitoring Integration Workflow

## Scenario: Complex Development Task with Monitoring

This example demonstrates how the monitoring system seamlessly integrates with the v5.0 framework's "Think ‚Üí Deploy Agent ‚Üí Track ‚Üí Done" pattern.

### User Request
"Build a REST API with authentication, including tests and documentation"

### Workflow with Integrated Monitoring

#### 1. THINK Phase (with Monitor awareness)

```
User: Build a REST API with authentication

Claude: Let me break this down:

/monitor                     # Quick status check first
üìä System Status: Healthy
ü§ñ Active Agents: 0/10     # Plenty of capacity
‚úÖ Tasks Completed: 0/0
‚ö° Performance: Optimal
üîç Issues: None

Using Progressive Thinking:
- API endpoints needed
- Authentication system
- Testing framework
- Documentation
```

#### 2. DEPLOY AGENT Phase (with Monitor tracking)

```
Deploying agents in parallel:

1. Context7 for FastAPI best practices
2. testing-specialist for TDD setup
3. general-purpose for implementation
4. documentation-specialist for API docs

[Monitor automatically tracks deployments]
üìä Agents Deployed: 4/10
üîÑ Status: All agents active
```

#### 3. TRACK Phase (with Monitor oversight)

```
TodoWrite + Monitor Integration:

[TodoWrite Tasks]
1. ‚úÖ Research FastAPI patterns
2. üîÑ Create authentication module
3. ‚è≥ Write API endpoints
4. ‚è≥ Add tests
5. ‚è≥ Generate documentation

[Monitor Real-time Updates]
‚ö° Agent Performance:
  - Context7: Complete (1.2s)
  - testing-specialist: Active (45s)
  - general-purpose: Active (30s)
  - documentation: Queued

üìà Progress: 35% complete
üî• CPU: 28% (Optimal)
```

#### 4. DONE Phase (with Monitor validation)

```
[Task Completion]
‚úÖ All tests passing (15/15)
‚úÖ API endpoints working
‚úÖ Documentation generated
‚úÖ Authentication implemented

[Monitor Final Report]
üìä TASK SUMMARY
================
Total Time: 3m 45s
Agents Used: 4
Parallel Efficiency: 87%
Quality Score: 100%
Test Coverage: 95%

Optimizations Applied:
- Parallel agent execution saved 2m
- Context7 cache hits improved speed
- No errors or retries needed
```

### Monitoring During Issues

#### Example: Performance Degradation

```
[During Task Execution]

üö® Monitor Alert: Performance degradation detected
  - Agent response time increased to 8s
  - Cause: High CPU usage (75%)
  
Automatic Response:
  - Deploying performance-monitor agent
  - Analyzing bottleneck...
  - Found: Sequential file operations
  - Solution: Switching to parallel I/O
  
‚úÖ Performance restored (response time: 1.5s)
```

#### Example: Quality Issue

```
[After Code Generation]

‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor Alert: Quality check failed
  - Missing tests for auth module
  - Evidence not provided for claims
  
Automatic Response:
  - Deploying testing-specialist
  - Writing missing test cases
  - Adding validation evidence
  
‚úÖ Quality standards met (100% coverage)
```

### Simple Commands in Action

#### Quick Status Check
```bash
/monitor

üìä System healthy | 2 agents active | 85% tasks done
```

#### Detailed Analysis
```bash
/monitor analyze

Deploying analysis agents...

üîç ANALYSIS COMPLETE
===================
Workflow Efficiency: 92%
Bottlenecks Found: 1
- Suggestion: Use cache for Context7 queries

Pattern Detected:
- TDD methodology improving quality
- Parallel agents reducing time by 65%
```

#### Tracking Specific Component
```bash
/monitor track agents

ü§ñ AGENT MONITORING
==================
general-purpose:     ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 60%
testing-specialist:  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 80%
context7-researcher: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100% ‚úÖ

Active: 2 | Complete: 1 | Queued: 0
```

### Integration Benefits

#### 1. Seamless Operation
- Monitoring happens automatically
- No extra commands needed
- Works within existing workflow

#### 2. Proactive Optimization
- Detects issues before they impact
- Suggests improvements in real-time
- Applies fixes automatically

#### 3. Simple Access
- One command for status: `/monitor`
- Details only when needed
- Clear, actionable information

#### 4. Quality Assurance
- Validates framework compliance
- Ensures evidence provision
- Maintains standards automatically

### Common Monitoring Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Start of Session
```
/monitor                    # Check system health
TodoWrite for planning      # Monitor tracks tasks
Deploy agents              # Monitor measures performance
```

#### Pattern 2: During Complex Work
```
Multiple agents running    # Monitor prevents conflicts
Performance degradation   # Monitor suggests optimization
Quality check            # Monitor ensures standards
```

#### Pattern 3: End of Session
```
/monitor analyze         # Review session efficiency
/done                   # Monitor captures metrics
Next session           # Monitor provides continuity
```

### Monitor Configuration

#### Enable Monitoring
```bash
/monitor enable
‚úÖ Monitoring enabled with:
  - System health checks every 30s
  - Performance tracking
  - Quality validation
  - Alert management
```

#### Adjust Sensitivity
```bash
/monitor config sensitivity low
‚úÖ Alert sensitivity set to LOW
  - Only critical issues will alert
  - Background monitoring continues
  - Dashboard updates available on request
```

#### View Historical Data
```bash
/monitor history

üìà LAST 24 HOURS
==============
Tasks: 156 completed
Agents: 412 deployments
Avg Response: 1.8s
Errors: 2 (resolved)
Optimizations: 15 applied
```

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**
   - Use `/monitor` for quick checks
   - Let automatic monitoring handle details
   - Only dive deep when issues arise

2. **Trust Automation**
   - Monitor deploys response agents automatically
   - Quality checks happen without intervention
   - Performance optimization is continuous

3. **Focus on Work**
   - Monitoring enhances, doesn't distract
   - Alerts only for important issues
   - Solutions suggested automatically

4. **Review Periodically**
   - `/monitor analyze` weekly
   - Check trends for improvements
   - Apply suggested optimizations

**Remember: Monitoring is powerful but invisible - it enhances without complicating.**
