```bash
mv /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/strategic-analysis/strategic-operations-orchestrator.md \
   /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/strategic-analysis/strategic-orchestrator-agent.md
```

Update YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
name: strategic-orchestrator
description: Coordinates complex planning and orchestrates multi-component workflows
```

## Deployment Commands

### Create Required Directories
```bash
mkdir -p /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/core-system
mkdir -p /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/technical-operations
mkdir -p /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/analysis-intelligence
```

### Validation Command
```bash
# Run after creating all agents
find /Users/nalve/.claude/agents -name "*agent.md" -type f | grep -E "(system-guardian|collaborative-partner|action-oriented|research-specialist|deep-thinker|strategic-orchestrator|knowledge-curator)" | wc -l
# Expected result: 7 (all personalities covered)
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Agent Files Exist
```bash
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/system-guardian-agent.md
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/collaborative-partner-agent.md  
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/action-oriented-assistant-agent.md
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/research-specialist-agent.md
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/deep-thinker-agent.md
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/strategic-orchestrator-agent.md
ls -la /Users/nalve/.claude/agents/*/knowledge-curator-agent.md
```

### 2. Test Agent Deployment in Claude Code
```bash
# In Claude Code, run:
/agents
# Verify all 7 agents appear in the list
```

### 3. Test Personality Workflow
Try each personality command from CLAUDE.md:
- "IF complex planning or coordination" ‚Üí Strategic Orchestrator
- "IF validating or protecting system" ‚Üí System Guardian  
- "IF exploring ideas together" ‚Üí Collaborative Partner
- "IF need efficient task completion" ‚Üí Action-Oriented Assistant
- "IF deep research required" ‚Üí Research Specialist
- "IF complex problem analysis" ‚Üí Deep Thinker
- "IF organizing knowledge/documentation" ‚Üí Knowledge Curator

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Framework Integrity Restored
- [ ] All 7 personalities have corresponding agents
- [ ] All agents deploy successfully in Claude Code
- [ ] All personality commands work without errors
- [ ] System promises match actual capabilities

### ‚úÖ Quality Standards Met
- [ ] All agents follow consistent YAML format
- [ ] Agent descriptions match personality use cases
- [ ] Appropriate tools assigned to each agent
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions used

### ‚úÖ User Experience Fixed
- [ ] No broken references in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Personality-based routing works reliably
- [ ] Users can depend on documented system behavior
- [ ] Framework credibility restored

## Post-Deployment Actions

1. **Update CLAUDE.md** if needed to reflect actual agent names
2. **Commit Changes** with proper documentation
3. **Test Integration** with existing workflows
4. **Document Lessons Learned** for future prevention
5. **Implement Sync Validation** to prevent recurrence

## Timeline

- **Immediate (30 minutes)**: Create all 5 missing agents
- **Validation (15 minutes)**: Test deployment and functionality  
- **Documentation (15 minutes)**: Update any inconsistencies
- **Total**: 60 minutes to fully restore framework integrity

This is the highest priority fix required to restore system reliability and user trust.
