### 3. Agent Selection Algorithm

#### Selection Criteria Matrix
```python
def select_optimal_agents(problem_domains, complexity_score, timeline_constraints):
    """
    Select optimal agent combination based on multiple criteria.
    """
    
    selection_criteria = {
        "domain_expertise": weight_domain_match(problem_domains),
        "complexity_capability": filter_by_complexity(complexity_score),
        "parallel_compatibility": assess_parallel_viability(timeline_constraints),
        "resource_efficiency": optimize_resource_usage(),
        "coordination_overhead": minimize_coordination_cost()
    }
    
    candidate_agents = get_domain_agents(problem_domains)
    scored_agents = []
    
    for agent in candidate_agents:
        score = calculate_agent_score(agent, selection_criteria)
        scored_agents.append((agent, score))
    
    # Select optimal combination
    return optimize_team_composition(scored_agents, complexity_score)

def optimize_team_composition(scored_agents, complexity_score):
    """Optimize team for parallel execution efficiency."""

    """Identify potential conflicts in agent combination."""
    
    conflicts = {
        "resource_conflicts": check_resource_overlap(selected_agents),

    """
    Automatically recommend optimal agents based on complexity assessment.
    """
    
    problem_domains = complexity_assessment["domains"]
    complexity_score = complexity_assessment["score"]

    # Get domain-appropriate agents
    candidate_agents = []
    for domain in problem_domains:
        domain_agents = get_agents_by_domain(domain)
        complexity_filtered = filter_agents_by_complexity(domain_agents, complexity_score)
        candidate_agents.extend(complexity_filtered)
    
    # Apply deployment pattern constraints
    if deployment_pattern == "parallel-coordination":
        return optimize_for_parallel_execution(candidate_agents)
    elif deployment_pattern == "sequential-agents":
        return optimize_for_sequential_execution(candidate_agents)
    else:
        return select_single_agent(candidate_agents)
```

### 2. Dynamic Team Adjustment
```python
def monitor_team_performance(active_agents):
    """Monitor parallel team performance and recommend adjustments."""
    
    performance_metrics = {
        "coordination_overhead": measure_coordination_time(active_agents),

        "conflict_frequency": count_resource_conflicts(active_agents),
        "quality_consistency": measure_output_quality(active_agents)
    }
    
    if performance_metrics["coordination_overhead"] > threshold:
        return recommend_team_simplification(active_agents)
    elif performance_metrics["productivity_rate"] < threshold:
        return recommend_team_enhancement(active_agents)
    
    return "maintain_current_team"
```

```
Task Analysis
├── Complexity Score 1-2: Single Agent
│   ├── Research → general_purpose
│   ├── Code Quality → code_quality_specialist  
│   └── Testing → testing_specialist
│
├── Complexity Score 3: Coordinated Pair
│   ├── API Development → api_design_specialist + testing_specialist
│   ├── Performance Issues → performance_optimizer + code_quality_specialist
│   └── Security → security_validator + testing_specialist
│
└── Complexity Score 4-5: Parallel Teams
    ├── Full Feature → api_design + integration + testing + security
    ├── System Migration → integration + performance + security + testing  
    └── Research Project → general_purpose + medical_literature + bibliography_verifier
```

### 3. Conflict Prevention Strategies

#### Resource Conflicts
```yaml
common_conflicts:
  file_editing:
    problem: "Multiple agents editing same files simultaneously"
    solution: "Assign file ownership or use coordination checkpoints"
    
  dependency_installation:
    problem: "Package.json modifications by multiple agents"  
    solution: "Single agent handles all dependency changes"
    
  git_operations:
    problem: "Concurrent commits and pushes"
    solution: "Designate git coordinator or serialize commits"
```

#### Domain Boundary Conflicts
```yaml
boundary_management:
  api_security_overlap:
    agents: [api_design_specialist, security_validator]
    solution: "API design owns endpoints, Security owns auth patterns"
    
  testing_quality_overlap:
    agents: [testing_specialist, code_quality_specialist]  
    solution: "Quality does static analysis, Testing does execution"
    
  performance_integration_overlap:
    agents: [performance_optimizer, integration_specialist]
    solution: "Integration owns architecture, Performance owns optimization"
```
