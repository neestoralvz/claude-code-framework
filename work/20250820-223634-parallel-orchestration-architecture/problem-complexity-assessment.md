# Problem Complexity Assessment System

## Executive Summary

Automated system for evaluating problem complexity and recommending optimal agent deployment patterns, enabling intelligent scaling from single-agent to parallel coordination based on objective criteria.

## Complexity Assessment Framework

### 1. Problem Dimension Analysis

#### Scope Complexity
**Single Domain (Complexity: 1-2)**
- Clear, well-defined problem space
- Single area of expertise required
- Limited stakeholder impact
- Example: "Fix broken link in documentation"

**Multi-Domain (Complexity: 3-4)**
- Crosses multiple knowledge areas
- Requires coordination between specialties
- Moderate stakeholder impact
- Example: "Implement new feature with database, API, and UI changes"

**Enterprise-Scale (Complexity: 5)**
- System-wide implications
- Multiple teams/departments affected
- High stakeholder impact
- Example: "Migrate entire architecture to new platform"

#### Dependency Complexity
**Independent (Complexity: 1)**
- No external dependencies
- Self-contained solution
- Single workflow path

**Sequential Dependencies (Complexity: 2-3)**
- Linear dependency chain
- Clear prerequisite relationships
- Predictable workflow

**Complex Dependencies (Complexity: 4-5)**
- Circular or multi-path dependencies
- Resource conflicts possible
- Requires coordination management

#### Time Complexity
**Immediate (Complexity: 1)**
- < 1 hour execution
- Single session completion
- No coordination required

**Short-term (Complexity: 2-3)**
- 1-8 hours execution
- May span multiple sessions
- Limited coordination needs

**Extended (Complexity: 4-5)**
- > 8 hours execution
- Multiple sessions required
- Significant coordination needs

#### Risk Complexity
**Low Risk (Complexity: 1-2)**
- Minimal failure impact
- Easy rollback/recovery
- Well-understood solution space

**Medium Risk (Complexity: 3-4)**
- Moderate failure impact
- Complex rollback procedures
- Some solution uncertainty

**High Risk (Complexity: 5)**
- Significant failure impact
- Difficult or impossible rollback
- High solution uncertainty

### 2. Complexity Scoring Algorithm

#### Calculation Method
```python
def calculate_complexity_score(scope, dependencies, time, risk):
    """
    Calculate overall complexity score from dimension assessments.
    Returns score 1-5 and recommended deployment pattern.
    """
    raw_score = (scope + dependencies + time + risk) / 4
    
    # Apply weighting factors
    if dependencies >= 4:  # Complex dependencies amplify complexity
        raw_score *= 1.2
    if risk >= 4:  # High risk amplifies complexity
        raw_score *= 1.1
    
    # Normalize to 1-5 scale
    complexity_score = min(5, max(1, round(raw_score)))
    
    return complexity_score, get_deployment_pattern(complexity_score)

def get_deployment_pattern(score):
    """Map complexity score to deployment pattern."""
    patterns = {
        1: "direct-execution",
        2: "single-agent",
        3: "sequential-agents", 
        4: "parallel-coordination",
        5: "enterprise-orchestration"
    }
    return patterns[score]
```

#### Deployment Pattern Mapping

**Complexity 1: Direct Execution**
- Orchestrator handles directly
- No agent deployment needed
- Examples: File reading, simple searches, basic information requests

**Complexity 2: Single Agent**
- Deploy one specialized agent
- Current framework standard
- Examples: Code creation, document analysis, system validation

**Complexity 3: Sequential Agents**
- Multiple agents in sequence
- Output of one feeds into next
- Examples: Research → Analysis → Implementation

**Complexity 4: Parallel Coordination**
- Multiple agents working simultaneously
- Orchestrator coordinates integration
- Examples: Multi-domain feature development, system migration planning

**Complexity 5: Enterprise Orchestration**
- Full parallel framework deployment
- Multiple coordination layers
- Advanced dependency management
- Examples: Complete system overhauls, large-scale integrations

### 3. Assessment Automation

#### Input Analysis Patterns
```python
complexity_indicators = {
    "scope_keywords": {
        "single": ["fix", "update", "change", "add"],
        "multi": ["implement", "create", "design", "integrate"],
        "enterprise": ["migrate", "transform", "overhaul", "rebuild"]
    },
    "dependency_keywords": {
        "independent": ["standalone", "isolated", "simple"],
        "sequential": ["depends on", "requires", "after"],
        "complex": ["coordination", "multiple teams", "system-wide"]
    },
    "time_indicators": {
        "immediate": ["quick", "fast", "simple", "basic"],
        "short": ["develop", "implement", "create"],
        "extended": ["comprehensive", "complete", "full", "entire"]
    },
    "risk_indicators": {
        "low": ["safe", "tested", "proven", "standard"],
        "medium": ["new", "experimental", "complex"],
        "high": ["critical", "production", "breaking", "irreversible"]
    }
}

def analyze_request_complexity(user_request):
    """Automatically assess complexity from user request text."""
    scope = assess_dimension(user_request, complexity_indicators["scope_keywords"])
    dependencies = assess_dimension(user_request, complexity_indicators["dependency_keywords"])
    time = assess_dimension(user_request, complexity_indicators["time_indicators"])
    risk = assess_dimension(user_request, complexity_indicators["risk_indicators"])
    
    return calculate_complexity_score(scope, dependencies, time, risk)
```

    complexity_range: [2, 4]
    parallel_compatible: false  # Requires coordination
```

### 2. Automatic Agent Selection

#### Selection Algorithm
```python
def recommend_agents(complexity_score, problem_domains, deployment_pattern):
    """
    Recommend optimal agent combination based on complexity and domains.
    """
    recommended_agents = []
    
    # Get agents for each domain
    for domain in problem_domains:
        domain_agents = get_domain_agents(domain)
        suitable_agents = filter_by_complexity(domain_agents, complexity_score)
        recommended_agents.extend(suitable_agents)
    
    # Apply deployment pattern constraints
    if deployment_pattern == "single-agent":
        return [select_best_generalist(recommended_agents)]
    elif deployment_pattern == "sequential-agents":
        return order_agents_sequentially(recommended_agents)
    elif deployment_pattern in ["parallel-coordination", "enterprise-orchestration"]:
        return optimize_parallel_combination(recommended_agents)
    
    return recommended_agents

def optimize_parallel_combination(agents):
    """Optimize agent combination for parallel execution."""
    # Remove redundant capabilities
    # Ensure complementary skill coverage
    # Minimize coordination overhead
    # Maximize parallel efficiency
    return optimized_agent_list
```

### 3. Dynamic Complexity Adjustment

#### Real-time Complexity Monitoring
```python
def monitor_execution_complexity():
    """Monitor actual complexity during execution and adjust if needed."""
    execution_metrics = {
        "coordination_overhead": measure_coordination_time(),
        "conflict_frequency": count_resource_conflicts(),
        "quality_gate_failures": count_validation_failures(),
        "timeline_variance": measure_schedule_variance()
    }
    
    if any(metric > threshold for metric in execution_metrics.values()):
        recommend_complexity_escalation()
    
    return execution_metrics

def recommend_complexity_escalation():
    """Recommend moving to higher complexity deployment pattern."""
    current_pattern = get_current_deployment_pattern()
    escalation_map = {
        "single-agent": "sequential-agents",
        "sequential-agents": "parallel-coordination", 
        "parallel-coordination": "enterprise-orchestration"
    }
    
    if current_pattern in escalation_map:
        return escalation_map[current_pattern]
    return current_pattern
```
