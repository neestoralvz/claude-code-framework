## INTEGRATION OVERVIEW

This document defines the seamless integration architecture for Claude Code hooks within the Simple and Easy Framework v4.0, ensuring ERROR ATTENTION PROTOCOL enforcement system-wide while maintaining framework coherence and simplicity.

## FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION POINTS

### 1. CORE METHODOLOGY INTEGRATION

**Progressive Thinking Integration**

- Agent deployment enforcement at Think level 2
- Validation requirements at Think level 3
- Meta-analysis optimization at Think level 4

**Agent Deployment Coordination**

### 2. WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS

**Session Management Integration**
```json
{
  "session_start": {
    "framework_status": "check core/00-system/index.md status",
    "todo_recovery": "restore persistent TodoWrite state",
    "agent_ecosystem": "initialize available agents",
    "personality_optimization": "load optimal personality blend"
  }
}
```

**Pre-Tool Validation Integration**
```json
{
  "pre_tool_use": {
    "framework_compliance": "validate Simple and Easy principles",
    "agent_deployment": "enforce specialized agent usage",
    "evidence_requirements": "validate evidence-based approach",
    "quality_gates": "check TDD/BDD methodology compliance"
  }
}
```

**Post-Tool Maintenance Integration**
```json
{
  "post_tool_use": {
    "git_workflow": "auto-commit with comprehensive documentation",
    "pattern_documentation": "update CLAUDE.md with discoveries",
    "framework_updates": "maintain system coherence",
    "optimization_detection": "identify continuous improvements"
  }
}
```

### 3. QUALITY ASSURANCE INTEGRATION

**Evidence-Based Validation**
- All hook outputs must provide verifiable evidence
- Integration with validation-and-demonstration-workflow.md
- Real-time framework compliance checking
- Quality metrics collection and reporting

**TDD/BDD Methodology Support**
- Hook integration with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
- Given-When-Then scenario validation
- Test-first development enforcement
- Behavior-driven hook execution

## SYSTEM-WIDE CONFIGURATION

### Global Settings Integration (/Users/nalve/.claude/settings.json)

The existing settings.json provides the foundation for system-wide hook integration. The current configuration already supports:

- SessionStart hooks for comprehensive orientation
- UserPromptSubmit hooks for context injection and agent enforcement
- PreToolUse hooks for workflow validation
- PostToolUse hooks for maintenance automation

### Project-Level Settings (.claude/settings.json)

For project-specific hook configurations, we extend the global pattern:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cd $(pwd) && python3 .claude/hooks/project_session_start.py",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command", 
            "command": "cd $(pwd) && python3 .claude/hooks/project_validation.py",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## CROSS-SYSTEM VALIDATION

### Integration Compatibility Matrix

| System Component | Hook Integration | Status | Validation Method |
|------------------|------------------|--------|-------------------|
| TodoWrite System | ✅ Complete | Active | Atomic task validation |
| Agent Deployment | ✅ Complete | Active | Specialized agent enforcement |
| Progressive Thinking | ✅ Complete | Active | 4-level methodology integration |
| Git Workflow | ✅ Complete | Active | Auto-commit with documentation |
| Quality Assurance | ✅ Complete | Active | TDD/BDD validation |
| Session Management | ✅ Complete | Active | Comprehensive orchestration |
| Personality System | ✅ Complete | Active | Dynamic personality blending |
| Command Matrix | ✅ Complete | Active | Optimal command sequencing |

### Framework Coherence Validation

**Simple and Easy Principle Compliance**
- All hooks maintain simplicity in operation
- Integration reduces complexity rather than adding it
- Easy deployment and maintenance
- Clear, actionable feedback from hook executions

**Universal Operation Mode Alignment**
- All 16 mandatory patterns supported by hook integration
- Automatic activation of universal patterns
- Maximum capability delivery through hook orchestration
- Perpetual optimization through continuous hook feedback

## ERROR ATTENTION PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

### System-Wide Error Detection

The hook system provides comprehensive error attention protocol enforcement:

1. **Pre-emptive Validation**: PreToolUse hooks prevent framework violations
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: PostToolUse hooks detect and correct issues
3. **Session Recovery**: SessionStart hooks restore optimal states
4. **User Guidance**: UserPromptSubmit hooks provide proactive guidance

### Error Escalation Patterns

```
Level 1: Hook Warning (Exit Code 1) → Continue with guidance
Level 2: Hook Error (Exit Code 2) → Block action, require correction
Level 3: Framework Violation → Activate recovery workflows
Level 4: System Crisis → Emergency protocols activation
```

## OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION

### Hook Execution Orchestration

**Parallel Hook Execution**
- Multiple hooks can execute concurrently when appropriate
- Maximum 10 concurrent hook processes (aligns with agent limits)
- Efficient resource utilization
- Coordinated result aggregation

**Hook State Management**

- Integration with framework state management
- Session continuity through hook coordination
- Recovery mechanisms for hook failures

### Integration with Existing Workflows
