# Agent Operations

This directory contains operational summaries and analysis files related to agent system development and deployment.

## Structure

- `AGENT-GAP-ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of agent gaps and creation roadmap
- `COMPLETE-AGENT-ECOSYSTEM-MATRIX.md` - Complete agent ecosystem mapping
- `FINAL-AGENT-CREATION-SUMMARY.md` - Final summary of agent creation process
- `NEW-AGENTS-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of newly created agents
- `MATRIX-TEST-SCENARIOS.md` - Test scenarios for workflow decision matrix

## Purpose

These are operational files that document:

1. **Analysis Results** - Gap analysis and ecosystem mapping
2. **Creation Summaries** - Documentation of agent development process
3. **Test Results** - Validation scenarios and outcomes
4. **Historical Records** - Tracking of agent system evolution

## Framework Integration

These operational files support the Simple Framework agent system but are separate from the core framework definitions found in `core/02-operations/agents/`.
