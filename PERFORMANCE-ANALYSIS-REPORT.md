     return a + b; // No validation
   }
   ```
   - **Performance Gain:** +100% (doubles throughput)
   - **Use Case:** Trusted, high-frequency operations
   - **Tradeoff:** No input validation or error handling

#### Medium Impact Optimizations

   ```javascript
   function sumOptimized(a, b) {
     if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
       throw new Error('Both arguments must be numbers');
     }
     return (a !== a || b !== b) ? NaN : a + b;
   }
   ```
   - **Performance Gain:** +15%
   - **Benefit:** Optimized branching and NaN detection

## 6. Caching and Optimization Strategies

### 6.1 Caching Analysis

**Conclusion:** Caching is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for this function.

**Rationale:**
- Computation cost (1 addition) < Cache lookup cost
- Infinite input space makes effective caching impractical
- Memory overhead outweighs performance benefits
- Cache management complexity adds unnecessary overhead

### 6.2 Recommended Optimization Patterns

1. **Function Specialization**
   - Create specialized variants for specific use cases
   - Example: `sumIntegers()`, `sumFloats()`, `sumUnsafe()`

2. **Input Preprocessing**
   - Batch validate inputs before processing loops
   - Pre-convert string numbers to avoid repeated parsing

3. **Context-Aware Optimization**
   - Use unsafe variants in trusted, performance-critical paths
   - Maintain safe variants for user-facing APIs

## 7. Performance Monitoring Setup

### 7.1 Continuous Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// Recommended monitoring approach
const performanceMonitor = {
  threshold: 8000000, // 8M ops/sec minimum
  alertOnRegression: 20%, // Alert if 20% slower
  samplingInterval: 1000ms,
  metricRetention: 24 * 60 // 24 hours
};
```

### 7.2 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Operations per Second:** Target >10M ops/sec
