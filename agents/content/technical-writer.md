  title: User Management API
  description: |
    Comprehensive user management system with authentication, 
    authorization, and profile management capabilities.
    
    ## Authentication
    
    This API uses Bearer token authentication. Include your token
    in the Authorization header:
    
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

### Scenario 2: Developer Setup Guide
```markdown
# Developer Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (version 8 or higher) or **yarn**
- **Git** (version 2.30 or higher)
- **Docker** (for local development environment)

### Verification

Verify your installations:

```bash
node --version    # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
npm --version     # Should show 8.0.0 or higher
git --version     # Should show 2.30.0 or higher
docker --version  # Should show 20.0.0 or higher
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/company/project.git
cd project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```bash
# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb

# API keys
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Development settings
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
```

### 4. Start Development Services

Start the required services using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

### 6. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use Git Flow for branch management:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### Creating a Feature

1. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
   ```

3. Push and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Standards

- **ESLint**: Run `npm run lint` to check code style
- **Prettier**: Run `npm run format` to format code
- **Tests**: Run `npm test` to execute test suite
- **Type Checking**: Run `npm run type-check` for TypeScript validation

### Commit Message Format

Follow Conventional Commits specification:

```
type(scope): description

feat(auth): add JWT token validation
fix(api): resolve user creation endpoint error
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Port Already in Use

If port 3000 is already in use:

```bash
# Find the process using the port
lsof -ti:3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

#### Database Connection Error

If you see database connection errors:

1. Verify PostgreSQL is running:
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps postgres
   ```

2. Check your database URL in `.env`
3. Ensure the database exists:
   ```bash
   npm run db:create
   ```

#### Module Not Found Errors

If you encounter module errors after pulling changes:

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
