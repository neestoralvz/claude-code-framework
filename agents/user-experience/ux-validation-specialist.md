## Operational Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery and Assessment
1. **Current State Analysis**
   - Audit existing UX patterns and components
   - Review user analytics and feedback data
   - Identify key user journeys and pain points
   - Assess current accessibility compliance

2. **Testing Protocol Design**
   - Define usability testing objectives
   - Create task scenarios and success criteria
   - Design measurement frameworks
   - Establish baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Validation and Testing
1. **Usability Testing Execution**
   - Conduct moderated or unmoderated testing sessions
   - Collect quantitative and qualitative data
   - Document user behaviors and feedback
   - Identify patterns and trends

2. **Interface Design Validation**
   - Review against established UX principles
   - Check consistency across components
   - Validate information architecture
   - Assess visual hierarchy and affordances

3. **Accessibility Validation**
