## Specialization Boundary Analysis

### Critical Boundary Clarifications Required

#### 1. Agent-Architect vs Agent-Creator
**Current Issue**: Potential capability overlap
**Required Resolution**: 
- agent-architect: Gold standard structure and design patterns
- agent-creator: Specialized agent building and deployment automation
**Priority**: üî• **IMMEDIATE**

#### 2. Monitoring vs Auditing vs Validation
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **WELL-DEFINED**
- monitoring-specialist: Real-time monitoring and alerting
- system-auditor: Static analysis and compliance validation
- validation-engineer: Quality methodology and evidence-based verification
**Boundary Clarity**: Excellent separation achieved

#### 3. Architecture Specialists Coordination
**Current Issue**: Need integration patterns between API, data, and infrastructure
**Required Resolution**: Define interaction protocols and shared patterns
**Priority**: üî¥ **HIGH**

### Successful Boundary Examples

#### Core System Division
**Excellent Model**: Clear separation of responsibilities
- enforcement-monitor: Framework compliance enforcement
- system-auditor: Static analysis and structural validation
- validation-engineer: Quality methodology and verification

**Replication Strategy**: Apply this boundary clarity model to other divisions
