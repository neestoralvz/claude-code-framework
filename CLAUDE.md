# Claude Code Framework - Command-Centered Architecture

⏺ **Principle**: Implement [directive.md ultimate authority](docs/principles/directive.md) through command-centered execution and apply [workflow.md systematic methodology](docs/principles/workflow.md) for consistent task completion.

This document serves as the orchestration hub for the Claude Code framework, providing access to modular components that implement [content-deduplication.md single-source truth methodology](docs/principles/content-deduplication.md). All framework knowledge exists in authoritative components with instructional links maintaining navigation efficiency.

## Framework Architecture Summary

This orchestration hub implements [content-deduplication.md single-source truth methodology](docs/principles/content-deduplication.md) by serving as the central access point to modular framework components. Each component maintains authoritative information for its domain, eliminating duplication while ensuring comprehensive framework access through instructional links.

### Modular Component Benefits
- **Single-source truth** - Each component serves as authoritative source for its domain
- **No information duplication** - All knowledge exists in exactly one location
- **Efficient navigation** - Instructional links provide direct access to authoritative information  
- **Maintenance efficiency** - Updates required in only one location per information domain
- **Framework coherence** - Modular architecture maintains system integrity and consistency

### CloudEco Integration Ready
The framework provides comprehensive execution triggers and automation patterns through the [command-flow-triggers.md component](docs/components/core-framework/command-flow-triggers.md), enabling seamless CloudEco workflow integration with automated command execution based on systematic trigger conditions.

*This document serves as the orchestration hub for the modularized Claude Code framework, providing efficient access to all framework capabilities through single-source authoritative components while eliminating content duplication and coordination overhead.*
