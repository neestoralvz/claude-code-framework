# Simple Framework Commands

_Last updated: 2025-08-20 | Version: 5.0 - Simple and Easy_

## Core Principle

**Keep it simple. Make it easy. Deploy agents for everything.**

## Basic Workflow

1. **Think** → Break down the request
2. **Deploy Agent** → Use Task tool with specialized agents 
3. **Track** → Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
4. **Done** → Agents do the work, you coordinate

## Essential Commands

**FOR ALL TASKS** → Deploy specialized agents with Task tool - NEVER work directly

**FOR ALL CODE/LIBRARIES** → Use Context7 first for current documentation

**FOR ALL TRACKING** → Use TodoWrite to break tasks into atomic components

**FOR ALL EVIDENCE** → Provide proof for claims - no assumptions

## Key Tools

- **Task** → Deploy specialized agents (general-purpose, testing-specialist, etc.)
- **TodoWrite** → Track progress on multi-step tasks
- **Context7** → Get current library documentation before coding
- **Progressive Think** → Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → Ultra Think
- **Monitor** → Continuous system observation and optimization

## Slash Commands

- **`/recenter`** → Reset when overwhelmed, return to simple principles
- **`/done`** → End session with proper documentation
- **`/project`** → Start new project with structured approach
- **`/monitor`** → System status dashboard and health monitoring

## Agent Deployment Pattern

```
FOR ALL WORK → Deploy agents in parallel (max 10 per message):
- Research agents for investigation
- Specialist agents for implementation  
- Validation agents for testing
- Documentation agents for recording
```

## Error Handling

**IF errors occur** → Deploy agents immediately, never normalize errors

**IF framework feels complex** → Use `/recenter` to return to simplicity

**IF uncertain** → Deploy research agents, get clarification

## Git Integration

**FOR ALL CHANGES** → Auto-commit with descriptive messages

**FOR ALL COMMITS** → Include comprehensive change documentation

## Quality Standards

**FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT** → Use TDD/BDD methodology through agents

**FOR ALL CLAIMS** → Provide evidence and validation

**FOR ALL CODE** → Context7 research first, then agent deployment

## System Integration

**Detailed workflows** → See `core/` directories for comprehensive processes

**Framework documentation** → See `core/00-system/` for system overview

**Advanced patterns** → Available in archived versions and core docs

**Monitoring system** → See `work/20250820-224500-monitoring-integration/universal-monitoring-system.md` for comprehensive monitoring

**Remember: Simple commands. Easy execution. Agent coordination.**
