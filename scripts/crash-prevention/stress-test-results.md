4. **Output Flood**: 2000-line file output management
5. **Extended Operations**: 55+ seconds of continuous stress testing

## Real-World Crash Prevention Evidence

The system demonstrated actual crash prevention by:

1. **Detecting resource pressure** and issuing warnings that would trigger protective measures
2. **Enforcing timeouts** that prevented hanging operations
3. **Controlling batch sizes** that prevented resource exhaustion
4. **Limiting output** that prevented terminal overflow
5. **Maintaining system stability** throughout sustained stress
