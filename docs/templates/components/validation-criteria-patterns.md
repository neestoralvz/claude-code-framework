## Usage Guidelines

### Pattern Selection
1. **Identify Context**: Determine the primary domain (Agent, Command, Component, Project, Quality, Analysis)
2. **Select Pattern**: Choose the most appropriate pre-defined pattern for your use case
3. **Customize Parameters**: Modify parameters as needed for specific requirements
4. **Validate Integration**: Ensure pattern aligns with framework validation protocols

### Custom Pattern Creation
When existing patterns don't fit:
1. Use the base `success-criteria-template.md` with custom parameters
2. Follow the established parameter naming conventions
3. Ensure integration with validation-engineer protocols
4. Document new patterns for potential addition to this library

### Migration Strategy
When migrating existing success criteria:
1. Identify the closest matching pattern
2. Extract custom requirements from existing criteria
3. Map to appropriate pattern parameters
4. Replace with pattern reference
5. Validate functional equivalence
