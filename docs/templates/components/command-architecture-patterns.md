## Architecture Overview

⏺ **Principle**: This documentation implements command-centered architecture patterns that transform commands from simple executors into complete execution environments.

### Command-Centered Architecture Vision
```yaml
transformation:
  from: "User Request → Main Assistant → Multiple Systems"
  to: "User Request → Command → Integrated Execution Environment"
  
benefits:
  - unified_execution: single_point_of_control
  - embedded_quality: built_in_validation
  - integrated_agents: automatic_deployment
  - complete_workflow: end_to_end_management
```

### Core Architecture Principles
1. **Complete Execution Environment**: Commands handle entire workflow internally
2. **Embedded Principle Application**: Direct application vs. external references
3. **Automatic Agent Deployment**: Intelligent agent selection and coordination
4. **Built-in Validation**: Four-gate quality assurance system
5. **Integrated Workflow**: 8-phase methodology with command adaptations

## Integration Patterns
