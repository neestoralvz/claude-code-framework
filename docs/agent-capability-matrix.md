## Agent Capability Overview

### monitoring-specialist: Real-Time Operational Monitoring
**Core Focus**: Live system performance tracking and immediate operational response

**Primary Capabilities**:
- Real-time performance metrics monitoring and live system tracking
- Active alerting infrastructure management and immediate notification systems
- Operational dashboard coordination for live visibility and real-time status
- Incident response orchestration for immediate operational issues
- Live monitoring infrastructure optimization and real-time resource management

**Operational Context**: Operates in live environments with continuous monitoring and immediate response requirements.

### system-auditor: Static Analysis and Compliance
**Core Focus**: Systematic static analysis and framework compliance verification

**Primary Capabilities**:
- Principle violation detection through comprehensive static code analysis
- Cross-reference integrity validation and systematic link verification
- File structure compliance monitoring and organizational verification
- Framework adherence auditing and comprehensive compliance reporting
- Static architecture analysis and structural assessment protocols

**Operational Context**: Operates through systematic static analysis without real-time monitoring requirements.

### validation-engineer: Quality Methodology and Validation
**Core Focus**: Evidence-based verification using systematic quality assurance methodologies

**Primary Capabilities**:
- 4-gate validation framework execution (Requirements, Process, Output, System)
- Evidence-based verification methodologies and SMART criteria validation
- Quality assurance protocol implementation and systematic validation frameworks
- Success criteria verification against established standards and measurable outcomes
- Comprehensive validation reporting with quantifiable evidence and methodology documentation

**Operational Context**: Operates through systematic quality methodology without real-time monitoring or static compliance analysis.

## Selection Decision Matrix

### Quick Selection Guide

| Task Category | monitoring-specialist | system-auditor | validation-engineer |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Live Performance Issues** | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Real-Time Alerts** | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Static Code Analysis** | ❌ No | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ No |
| **Compliance Auditing** | ❌ No | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ No |
| **Quality Methodology** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ PRIMARY |
| **Success Criteria Validation** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ PRIMARY |
| **Framework Integrity** | ❌ No | ✅ PRIMARY | ❌ No |
| **Evidence-Based Verification** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ PRIMARY |

### Detailed Selection Criteria

#### Use monitoring-specialist when:
- **Live System Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and operational metrics
- **Active Alerting**: Immediate notification systems and incident response
- **Operational Dashboards**: Live visibility and real-time status coordination
- **Performance Issues**: Immediate detection and response to live system problems
- **Infrastructure Management**: Real-time monitoring system optimization

#### Use system-auditor when:
- **Static Analysis**: Code structure analysis and principle violation detection
- **Compliance Verification**: Framework adherence and organizational standard validation
- **Structural Assessment**: File organization and cross-reference integrity verification
- **Architecture Review**: Static system design analysis and improvement identification
- **Audit Reporting**: Comprehensive compliance documentation and evidence collection

#### Use validation-engineer when:
- **Quality Gates**: 4-gate validation framework implementation and execution
- **Methodology Implementation**: Systematic quality assurance protocol deployment
- **Success Verification**: Evidence-based validation against established criteria
- **Validation Reporting**: Comprehensive quality documentation with measurable outcomes
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic validation methodology and framework management

## Task-to-Agent Mapping

### Development Workflow Integration

| Workflow Phase | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Coordination |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Real-Time Monitoring** | monitoring-specialist | - | Live metrics and immediate response |
| **Static Code Review** | system-auditor | - | Compliance and structural analysis |
| **Quality Validation** | validation-engineer | - | Evidence-based verification |
| **Incident Response** | monitoring-specialist | system-auditor | Real-time response + compliance check |
| **Framework Audit** | system-auditor | validation-engineer | Static analysis + methodology validation |
| **Comprehensive Validation** | validation-engineer | system-auditor | Quality methodology + compliance verification |

### Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Live Issue Resolution
1. **monitoring-specialist**: Detect and respond to immediate operational issues
2. **system-auditor**: Analyze structural causes and compliance implications
3. **validation-engineer**: Validate resolution against quality criteria

#### Pattern 2: Framework Compliance
1. **system-auditor**: Conduct comprehensive static analysis and compliance audit
2. **validation-engineer**: Validate compliance methodology and evidence quality
3. **monitoring-specialist**: Establish ongoing monitoring for compliance maintenance

#### Pattern 3: Quality Assurance
1. **validation-engineer**: Execute comprehensive quality validation methodology
2. **system-auditor**: Verify structural compliance and framework adherence
3. **monitoring-specialist**: Implement ongoing quality monitoring and alerting

## Integration Patterns

### Seamless Agent Coordination

#### Non-Overlapping Boundaries
- **monitoring-specialist**: Operates exclusively in real-time operational environments
- **system-auditor**: Operates exclusively through static analysis and compliance verification
- **validation-engineer**: Operates exclusively through quality methodology and evidence-based verification

#### Complementary Capabilities
- **Real-Time + Static**: monitoring-specialist provides immediate detection; system-auditor provides structural analysis
- **Static + Quality**: system-auditor provides compliance verification; validation-engineer provides methodology validation
- **Quality + Real-Time**: validation-engineer provides systematic validation; monitoring-specialist provides ongoing quality monitoring

#### Sequential Deployment Patterns
1. **Issue Detection → Analysis → Validation**: monitoring-specialist → system-auditor → validation-engineer
2. **Audit → Methodology → Monitoring**: system-auditor → validation-engineer → monitoring-specialist
3. **Validation → Compliance → Monitoring**: validation-engineer → system-auditor → monitoring-specialist

## Quality Assurance

### Agent Selection Validation

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **Task Requirements Clear**: Specific needs identified and categorized
- [ ] **Agent Capability Match**: Selected agent's expertise aligns with task requirements
- [ ] **Boundary Respect**: No overlap with other agent capabilities
- [ ] **Integration Plan**: Clear coordination strategy if multiple agents needed
