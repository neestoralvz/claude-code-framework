## Agent Deployment Execution

Each agent receives identical user request with specialized analysis instructions:

**Agent 1 - General Purpose**: 
- Analyze overall request complexity and technical scope
- Identify primary domain and secondary requirements
- Assess resource requirements and execution timeline

**Agent 2 - UX Architect**:
- Evaluate user experience implications and interface requirements
- Identify accessibility considerations and design patterns
- Assess user-centered design opportunities

**Agent 3 - Project Optimizer**:
- Analyze project structure impact and optimization opportunities
- Identify architectural patterns and modularization potential
- Assess system-wide improvement possibilities

**Agent 4 - System Auditor**:
- Evaluate compliance requirements and validation needs
- Identify quality gates and standards adherence
- Assess risk factors and mitigation strategies

**Agent 5 - Delegation Advisor**:
- Recommend optimal command routing and agent selection
- Identify execution path optimization opportunities
- Assess resource allocation and coordination requirements

## Analysis Coordination Protocol

1. **Simultaneous Deployment**: All agents launched concurrently via Task tool
2. **Synchronized Objectives**: Each agent receives identical user request with specialized focus
3. **Independent Analysis**: Agents work autonomously without cross-communication
4. **Result Collection**: Command orchestrator collects all agent analyses
5. **Synthesis Generation**: Command integrates perspectives into unified analysis
