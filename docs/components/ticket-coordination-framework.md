# Ticket Coordination Framework

## Overview

The Ticket Coordination Framework provides comprehensive algorithms and workflows for systematic ticket orchestration, dependency resolution, and execution optimization. This framework enables automated coordination of complex ticket ecosystems with intelligent scheduling and resource management.

## Core Coordination Algorithms

### 1. Dependency Resolution Algorithm

```
DEPENDENCY_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL:
  INPUT: Ticket_Set, Dependency_Graph, Resource_Constraints
  
  PHASE_1_DISCOVERY:
    - Map direct dependencies (blocking, sequential, soft)
    - Identify transitive relationships through graph traversal
    - Detect circular dependencies and flag for resolution
    - Calculate dependency depth and critical path analysis
    
  PHASE_2_ANALYSIS:
    - Assess dependency strength and coupling intensity
    - Identify dependency clusters and execution groups
    - Evaluate resolution strategies for circular dependencies
    - Calculate execution sequence optimization opportunities
    
  PHASE_3_OPTIMIZATION:
    - Generate execution sequences minimizing wait times
    - Optimize for parallel execution opportunities
    - Balance resource constraints with execution efficiency
    - Create fallback sequences for dependency failures
    
  OUTPUT: Optimized_Execution_Plan, Dependency_Warnings, Resolution_Strategies
```

### 2. Priority Clustering Algorithm

```
PRIORITY_CLUSTERING_PROTOCOL:
  INPUT: Ticket_Priority_Data, Resource_Availability, Timeline_Constraints
  
  CLUSTERING_ANALYSIS:
    - Group tickets by priority levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
    - Identify resource affinity patterns for batch processing
    - Calculate clustering efficiency scores and optimization potential
    - Assess timeline impact and deadline constraint satisfaction
    
  OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY:
    - Create priority-based execution clusters with resource efficiency
    - Balance high-priority immediate execution with batch efficiency
    - Optimize cluster sizing for resource utilization and completion velocity
    - Generate adaptive scheduling for dynamic priority changes
    
  OUTPUT: Priority_Clusters, Execution_Sequences, Resource_Allocation_Plan
```

### 3. Resource Conflict Resolution

```
RESOURCE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION:
  INPUT: Resource_Requirements, Availability_Matrix, Constraint_Rules
  
  CONFLICT_DETECTION:
    - Identify resource overlap and competition scenarios
    - Map resource dependency chains and utilization patterns
    - Detect scheduling conflicts and resource bottlenecks
    - Calculate resource efficiency and optimization opportunities
    
  RESOLUTION_STRATEGIES:
    - Implement resource sharing protocols for compatible tickets
    - Create time-slicing strategies for sequential resource usage
    - Design resource substitution patterns for constraint mitigation
    - Generate escalation protocols for unresolvable conflicts
    
  OUTPUT: Conflict_Resolution_Plan, Resource_Schedule, Escalation_Triggers
```

## Workflow Orchestration Patterns

### Ticket Lifecycle Coordination

```
TICKET_LIFECYCLE_ORCHESTRATION:
  
  DISCOVERY_PHASE:
    - Auto-scan for new tickets across all generation sources
    - Classify tickets by type, priority, and coordination requirements
    - Validate ticket completeness and orchestration readiness
    
  COORDINATION_PHASE:
    - Apply dependency resolution algorithms
    - Execute priority clustering and resource optimization
    - Generate intelligent execution schedules with monitoring hooks
    
  EXECUTION_PHASE:
    - Monitor ticket execution progress and dependency satisfaction
    - Implement adaptive scheduling for dynamic changes and conflicts
    - Coordinate parallel execution and resource sharing optimization
    
  COMPLETION_PHASE:
    - Validate ticket completion against acceptance criteria
    - Update dependency relationships and release blocked tickets
    - Generate orchestration metrics and improvement insights
```

### Batch Processing Optimization

```
BATCH_PROCESSING_STRATEGY:
  
  BATCH_IDENTIFICATION:
    - Group tickets by resource requirements and execution patterns
    - Identify parallelizable tickets with minimal dependencies
    - Optimize batch sizes for resource efficiency and completion velocity
    
  EXECUTION_COORDINATION:
    - Coordinate parallel execution within resource constraints
    - Implement progress monitoring and failure recovery protocols
    - Balance batch efficiency with individual ticket priority requirements
    
  COMPLETION_VERIFICATION:
    - Validate batch completion and individual ticket success criteria
    - Update orchestration state and dependency resolution status
    - Generate batch performance metrics and optimization recommendations
```
