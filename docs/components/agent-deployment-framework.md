## Automatic Specialist Deployment

This framework automatically assesses audit complexity and deploys appropriate specialists without external intervention.

### How Specialist Assessment Works
The framework evaluates these factors to choose specialists:

**Assessment criteria:**
- Audit scope: single directory, multiple directories, or full system
- Complexity level: basic, comprehensive, or deep analysis
- Violation density: low, medium, or high
- Integration requirements: minimal, standard, or intensive

**Deployment decisions:**
- Basic audit: direct execution
- Comprehensive audit: system auditor specialist
- Deep analysis: project optimizer with system focus
- Pattern analysis: specialized analysis specialist

### How Deployment Decisions Get Made
1. **Scope Analysis**: Automatic assessment of audit requirements
2. **Capability Matching**: Match requirements to available audit specialists
3. **Resource Allocation**: Optimize specialist deployment for audit efficiency
4. **Integration Management**: Handle specialist coordination internally
