## Framework Overview

⏺ **Principle**: This framework implements [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) by automating ticket generation from audit findings, eliminating manual overhead while ensuring comprehensive issue tracking and systematic resolution.

### Core Capabilities
The auto-ticket generation framework provides:

1. **Real-time Violation Detection**: Automatic identification of framework violations during audit execution
2. **Intelligent Ticket Creation**: Template-based ticket generation with appropriate categorization and priority assignment
3. **Seamless Registry Integration**: Automatic TICKET_REGISTRY.md updates with proper cross-referencing
4. **Quality Validation**: Built-in validation for generated tickets ensuring completeness and accuracy
5. **Evidence Collection**: Automatic documentation of violation evidence and remediation requirements

### Supported Violation Types
- **Simplicity Violations**: Files exceeding 250-line complexity threshold
- **Code Duplication**: Pattern similarity above 70% threshold across multiple files
- **Agent Redundancy**: Repeated agent selection/deployment patterns across framework
- **Component Extraction**: Identified opportunities for modularization and component extraction

## Violation Detection Matrix

### Detection Triggers and Templates

```yaml
violation_detection_matrix:
  simplicity_violations:
    trigger_condition: file_line_count > 250
    severity_assessment: HIGH
    ticket_template: audit-simp-###
    priority_assignment: HIGH
    category: audit
    estimated_effort_formula: "((line_count - 250) / 100) + 2 hours"
    auto_generation: enabled
    
  code_duplication:
    trigger_condition: pattern_similarity > 70%
    severity_assessment: 
      - similarity_90_plus: HIGH
      - similarity_80_90: MEDIUM
      - similarity_70_80: LOW
    ticket_template: audit-dup-###
    priority_assignment: dynamic_based_on_severity
    category: audit
    estimated_effort_formula: "(affected_files / 50) + 2 hours"
    auto_generation: enabled
    
  agent_redundancy:
    trigger_condition: agent_pattern_occurrences > 5
    severity_assessment: HIGH
    ticket_template: audit-agent-###
    priority_assignment: HIGH
    category: audit
    estimated_effort_formula: "(pattern_occurrences / 100) + 4 hours"
    auto_generation: enabled
    
  extractable_components:
    trigger_condition: component_extraction_opportunity_detected
    severity_assessment: MEDIUM
    ticket_template: audit-comp-###
    priority_assignment: MEDIUM
    category: audit
    estimated_effort_formula: "component_complexity_assessment + 1 hour"
    auto_generation: enabled
```

### Priority Assignment Logic

#### HIGH Priority Triggers
- Simplicity violations exceeding 300 lines
- Code duplication affecting 100+ files
- Agent redundancy with 1000+ occurrences
- Critical component extraction opportunities

#### MEDIUM Priority Triggers
- Simplicity violations 250-300 lines
- Code duplication affecting 20-100 files
- Agent redundancy with 100-1000 occurrences
- Standard component extraction opportunities

#### LOW Priority Triggers
- Minor duplication affecting <20 files
- Small component extraction opportunities
- Optimization improvements

## Automatic Ticket Generation Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection and Assessment
```yaml
detection_phase:
  violation_scanning:
    - real_time_analysis: during_audit_execution
    - threshold_checking: automatic_compliance_verification
    - severity_assessment: impact_and_scope_analysis
    - evidence_collection: violation_documentation
    
  trigger_evaluation:
    - condition_matching: violation_type_identification
    - priority_calculation: severity_and_impact_based
    - template_selection: intelligent_template_matching
    - effort_estimation: automatic_calculation
```

### Phase 2: Ticket Content Generation
```yaml
content_generation:
  template_population:
    - violation_data_insertion: automatic_evidence_inclusion
    - impact_analysis: scope_and_affected_files
    - solution_framework: standard_remediation_approach
    - acceptance_criteria: measurable_success_metrics
    
  quality_validation:
    - completeness_check: all_required_fields_populated
    - accuracy_verification: evidence_and_data_validation
    - consistency_check: template_structure_compliance
    - actionability_assessment: clear_implementation_steps
```

### Phase 3: Registry Integration
```yaml
registry_integration:
  ticket_insertion:
    - id_assignment: sequential_numbering_by_category
    - priority_placement: appropriate_section_insertion
    - cross_reference_creation: bidirectional_link_establishment
    - status_initialization: pending_status_assignment
    
  registry_updates:
    - summary_statistics: automatic_count_updates
    - progress_metrics: completion_percentage_recalculation
    - trend_analysis: auto_generation_impact_tracking
    - validation_confirmation: registry_integrity_verification
```

### Phase 4: Validation and Confirmation
```yaml
validation_phase:
  ticket_quality_gates:
    - requirements_gate: violation_clearly_documented
    - process_gate: template_structure_followed
    - output_gate: actionable_implementation_steps
    - system_gate: registry_integration_successful
    
  confirmation_reporting:
    - generation_summary: tickets_created_count_and_types
    - priority_distribution: breakdown_by_severity
    - estimated_effort: total_work_hours_calculated
    - next_actions: recommended_execution_sequence
```

## Registry Integration Patterns

### Automatic Registry Updates

#### Status Summary Updates
```yaml
status_summary_updates:
  ticket_counts:
    - total_increment: new_tickets_added_to_total
    - pending_increment: new_tickets_added_to_pending
    - percentage_recalculation: completion_rate_adjustment
    
  progress_tracking:
    - completion_percentage: (completed / total) * 100
    - trend_analysis: auto_generation_impact_documentation
    - priority_distribution: high_medium_low_breakdown
```

#### Active Tickets Section Updates
```yaml
active_tickets_updates:
  priority_sections:
    - high_priority_insertion: automatic_high_priority_placement
    - medium_priority_insertion: appropriate_section_placement
    - low_priority_insertion: maintenance_category_placement
    
  cross_references:
    - ticket_file_links: automatic_path_generation
    - bidirectional_references: consistent_link_establishment
    - navigation_integrity: link_validation_confirmation
```
