# Command Priority Assignment Matrix Component

## Purpose
Reusable automated priority assignment matrix for command-centered task management.

## Priority Assignment Framework
```yaml
priority_matrix:
  critical_priority:
    criteria:
      - system_failures: immediate_impact_on_operations
      - security_vulnerabilities: immediate_security_risk
      - data_loss_potential: immediate_data_protection_risk
      - workflow_blockages: prevents_other_work_completion
    auto_escalation: immediate
    
  high_priority:
    criteria:
      - principle_violations: framework_compliance_issues
      - functionality_gaps: missing_core_capabilities
      - significant_inefficiencies: major_productivity_impact
      - integration_issues: system_compatibility_problems
    auto_escalation: within_24_hours
    
  medium_priority:
    criteria:
      - feature_enhancements: productivity_improvements
      - documentation_gaps: information_completeness_issues
      - minor_inefficiencies: small_productivity_impact
      - optimization_opportunities: performance_improvements
    auto_escalation: within_week
    
  low_priority:
    criteria:
      - aesthetic_improvements: visual_or_style_enhancements
      - convenience_features: nice_to_have_functionality
      - minor_optimizations: small_efficiency_gains
      - future_considerations: long_term_planning_items
    auto_escalation: scheduled_maintenance
```

## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Criteria Evaluation**: Assess tasks against priority criteria automatically
2. **Auto-Escalation**: Apply escalation timelines based on priority assignment
3. **Matrix Adaptation**: Customize criteria to match your domain requirements
4. **Integration Points**: Connect with workflow phases and validation gates

## Usage Examples
- **Ticket Creation**: Automatic priority assignment during ticket generation
- **Task Management**: Priority-based queue management and execution ordering
- **Resource Allocation**: Priority-driven resource assignment and scheduling
- **Quality Assurance**: Priority-based validation depth and thoroughness

## Component Integration
- **Reference**: `[Priority Assignment Matrix](../../docs/components/command-priority-assignment-matrix.md)`
- **Application**: Embed in command logic for automatic priority determination
- **Validation**: Consistent priority assignment across command architecture
