# Command Flow Triggers

⏺ **Authority**: This component serves as the single authoritative source for command execution triggers, automation patterns, and CloudEco workflow integration within the Claude Code framework.

## Execution Trigger Framework

### Automated Trigger Categories

#### System Health Triggers
Conditions that automatically initiate system maintenance:
- **File complexity violations detected** → [Execute modularize.md](../../../commands/analysis/modularize.md)
- **System inconsistencies identified** → [Execute system-audit.md](../../../commands/analysis/system-audit.md)
- **Dependency conflicts discovered** → [Execute analyze-dependencies.md](../../../commands/analysis/analyze-dependencies.md)
- **Quality gate failures encountered** → [Execute 9-debug.md](../../../commands/workflow/9-debug.md)

#### Scheduled Maintenance Triggers
Regular framework maintenance patterns:
- **Daily system health checks** → [Execute system-audit.md](../../../commands/analysis/system-audit.md)
- **Weekly ticket review cycles** → [Execute review-tickets.md](../../../commands/management/review-tickets.md)
- **Monthly optimization cycles** → [Execute 10-recurse.md](../../../commands/workflow/10-recurse.md)
- **Quarterly framework evolution** → [Execute multi-analysis-execution.md](../../../commands/orchestration/multi-analysis-execution.md)

#### User-Initiated Triggers
Direct user requests and manual operations:
- **New task requests received** → Use [command selection framework](command-selection.md) for optimal command choice
- **Problem reports submitted** → [Execute 9-debug.md](../../../commands/workflow/9-debug.md) for systematic diagnosis
- **Improvement opportunities identified** → [Execute 10-recurse.md](../../../commands/workflow/10-recurse.md) for enhancement
- **Complex analysis required** → [Execute multi-analysis-execution.md](../../../commands/orchestration/multi-analysis-execution.md)

### CloudEco Integration Patterns

#### Workflow Execution Triggers
Integration points for CloudEco automation:

##### Development Workflow Triggers
```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  code_complexity_threshold_exceeded:
    command: "modularize.md"
    parameters:
      scope: "comprehensive"
      priority: "HIGH"
    
  system_audit_scheduled:
    command: "system-audit.md"
    parameters:
      scope: "comprehensive"
      auto_ticket_generation: true
    
  quality_gate_failure:
    command: "9-debug.md"
    parameters:
      focus: "quality"
      depth: "root-cause"
```

##### Task Management Triggers
```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  new_requirements_received:
    command: "create-ticket.md"
    parameters:
      priority_classification: true
      specialist_assignment: true
    
  ticket_review_cycle:
    command: "review-tickets.md"
    parameters:
      execution_mode: "priority-based"
      parallel_execution: true
    
  complex_task_analysis_needed:
    command: "multi-analysis-execution.md"
    parameters:
      analysis_types: ["exploration", "research", "sales"]
      output_format: "JSON"
```

##### Quality Assurance Triggers
```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  validation_failure_detected:
    command: "8-validate.md"
    parameters:
      validation_level: "comprehensive"
      evidence_collection: true
    
  iterative_improvement_opportunity:
    command: "10-recurse.md"
    parameters:
      strategy: "enhancement"
      quality_focus: true
    
  system_inconsistency_found:
    command: "system-audit.md"
    parameters:
      focus: "consistency"
      auto_remediation: true
```

## Command Execution Flow Patterns

### Single Command Execution
For straightforward tasks with clear command mapping:

```
User Request → Trigger Analysis → Command Selection → Direct Execution → Results
```

**Implementation:**
1. Analyze trigger condition against [command selection criteria](command-selection.md)
2. Select optimal command using decision tree
3. Execute command with appropriate parameters
4. Return validated results

### Workflow Phase Execution
For complex tasks requiring systematic approach:

```
User Request → Phase Assessment → Workflow Entry Point → Phase Sequence → Validation
```

**Implementation:**
1. Determine appropriate workflow entry point (phases 1-8)
2. Execute systematic phase progression
3. Apply built-in validation at each phase
4. Ensure complete workflow completion

### Orchestrated Multi-Command Execution
For complex analysis requiring multiple perspectives:

```
User Request → Analysis Requirements → Parallel Command Deployment → Result Synthesis → Report Generation
```

**Implementation:**
1. [Execute multi-analysis-execution.md](../../../commands/orchestration/multi-analysis-execution.md) for coordination
2. Deploy specialized analysis commands in parallel
3. Synthesize results using JSON integration
4. Generate comprehensive consolidated reports

## Integration Protocol Implementation

### CloudEco Webhook Integration

#### Trigger Event Handling
```javascript
// Example CloudEco integration pattern
const handleWorkflowTrigger = (event) => {
  const triggerMapping = {
    'complexity_violation': 'commands/analysis/modularize.md',
    'system_health_check': 'commands/analysis/system-audit.md',
    'quality_failure': 'commands/workflow/9-debug.md',
    'new_task_request': 'command-selection-framework'
  };
  
  return executeCommand(triggerMapping[event.type], event.parameters);
};
```

#### Automated Response Patterns
- **Immediate execution** for critical system health issues
- **Scheduled execution** for routine maintenance operations
- **Queued execution** for complex analysis requirements
- **Priority execution** for high-impact quality issues

### Execution Context Management

#### Context Preservation Patterns
- **Session continuity** across multi-phase workflows
- **State persistence** for long-running operations
- **Result correlation** for related command executions
- **Error context** for debugging and remediation

#### Parameter Passing Protocols
- **Standard parameters** for common execution options
- **Context parameters** for workflow state and history
- **Quality parameters** for validation and compliance requirements
- **Integration parameters** for CloudEco coordination

## Trigger Validation and Testing

### Trigger Condition Validation
- **Condition accuracy** - Verify triggers activate under correct circumstances
- **Command mapping** - Ensure optimal command selection for each trigger
- **Parameter validation** - Confirm appropriate parameters passed to commands
- **Execution verification** - Validate commands execute successfully

### Integration Testing Protocols
- **End-to-end workflow testing** from trigger to completion
- **CloudEco integration validation** across different trigger types
- **Performance testing** for high-frequency automated triggers
- **Error handling validation** for failed or invalid triggers
