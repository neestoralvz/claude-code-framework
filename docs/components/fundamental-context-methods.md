# FUNDAMENTAL CONTEXT METHODS

## Purpose

⏺ **Principle**: These methods implement [fundamental.md](../principles/fundamental.md) by providing context-aware approaches that adapt fundamental patterns to specific requirements and constraints.

Defines adaptive methods for implementing fundamental principles across different contexts and integration scenarios.

## Context-Aware Implementation Approaches

### Audience-Based Context Method
- Identify target audience experience level
- Adjust complexity accordingly
- Select appropriate evidence depth
- Tailor validation criteria

### Requirement-Based Context Method
- Assess project constraints
- Define minimum viable compliance
- Select applicable simplicity patterns
- Implement proportional validation

### Integration-Based Context Method
- Analyze existing system patterns
- Identify integration touchpoints
- Apply consistent fundamental approaches
- Maintain workflow compatibility

## Adaptive Pattern Selection

### High-Complexity Contexts
- Apply aggressive simplification patterns
- Use comprehensive evidence templates
- Implement systematic validation procedures
- Focus on essential functionality only

### Low-Complexity Contexts
- Apply minimal simplification patterns
- Use streamlined evidence collection
- Implement lightweight validation
- Maintain essential quality standards

## Integration Methods

### Workflow Integration
- Apply during [workflow phases](workflow-phases.md) systematically
- Use phase-specific fundamental patterns
- Integrate evidence collection with validation phases
- Maintain consistency across workflow stages

### Engineering Integration
- Apply fundamental patterns to engineering standards
- Use evidence-based technical validation
- Integrate simplicity principles with quality metrics
- Maintain technical rigor while reducing complexity

## Context Selection Guidelines

### Selection Criteria
- Project complexity level
- Team experience requirements
- Integration constraints
- Time and resource limitations

### Implementation Approach
- Start with simplest applicable pattern
- Escalate complexity only when essential
- Use evidence to validate context appropriateness
- Adapt based on implementation results
