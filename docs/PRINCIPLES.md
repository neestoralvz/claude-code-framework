## Essential Working Principles

This section shows you how to apply execution rules systematically.

**All principle loading follows the main CLAUDE.md guide exclusively.**

The complete principle application sequence comes from CLAUDE.md Step 2, which provides the definitive loading order that overrides all other sequences. Access individual principles through their specialized guides:

1. **Execute workflow principles** - Learn systematic execution methodology
2. **Follow directive principles** - Understand core command adherence and authority patterns
3. **Apply fundamental principles** - Learn basic methodology and evidence requirements
4. **Implement engineering principles** - Follow technical standards and quality patterns
5. **Apply git workflow principles** - Use version control integration standards
6. **Enable dynamic adaptation principles** - Allow framework evolution within guidelines
7. **Apply context efficiency principles** - Preserve context through delegation
8. **Use agent selection principles** - Deploy multiple perspectives with agents
9. **Apply task orchestration principles** - Use concurrent Task Tool deployment
9a. **Use task tool syntax principles** - Follow complete Task Tool invocation framework
10. **Follow agent definition principles** - Maintain specialized agent boundaries
11. **Apply expert documentation principles** - Follow expert documentation standards
12. **Apply simplicity principles** - Include essential information only
13. **Apply content deduplication principles** - Maintain single-source truth and eliminate information duplication
14. **Use communication principles** - Communicate directly and clearly
15. **Structure with organization principles** - Organize everything logically
16. **Format using formatting principles** - Apply consistent formatting
17. **Manage via file principles** - Handle files efficiently
18. **Check forbidden principles** - Avoid prohibited restrictions
19. **Write using claude-md principles** - Follow CLAUDE.md writing guidelines

## Which Guide Has Ultimate Authority

**All principle loading sequences come exclusively from the main CLAUDE.md guide Step 2 as the single authoritative source.**

**The main CLAUDE.md guide has ultimate authority** and contains the definitive initialization sequence that overrides all other loading order references. This document provides no competing sequence and defers completely to CLAUDE.md authority.
