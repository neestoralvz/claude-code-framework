How to navigate the Claude Code documentation system. Start here when you need to find guides, principles, or specific commands.
# Find What You Need

**Quick Links**: [Commands](../commands/index.md) | [Main Guide](../CLAUDE.md) | [Core Principles](PRINCIPLES.md) | [All Commands](../commands/index.md)

## What You Can Do Here

1. [Get Started](#get-started)
2. [Use System Components](#use-system-components)
3. [Run Commands](#run-commands)
4. [Work with Specialists](#work-with-specialists)
5. [Apply Templates](#apply-templates)
6. [Find References](#find-references)

## Get Started

**Most Important Rule**: The main CLAUDE.md guide controls everything about how to start and initialize the system.

This navigation document helps you find things, but the main guide tells you exactly what to do for initialization.

**To start properly, follow the initialization sequence in the main CLAUDE.md guide exclusively.**

## Use System Components

Components implement modular design principles to avoid duplication and keep things organized.

1. **Read the components guide to understand the architecture** - Learn the difference between principles and components
2. **Apply the workflow guide for systematic command execution** - Follow the systematic phases
3. **Use the link standards for consistent navigation** - Create consistent navigation patterns
4. **Follow the link format standards** - Apply navigation standards correctly

## Run Commands

Command execution follows systematic phases to get consistent results every time.

1. **Run system audit to analyze the system** - Get comprehensive system analysis
2. **Create tickets to generate tasks** - Generate standardized task tickets
3. **Run modularize to break down code** - Refactor large code into manageable components
4. **Review tickets to execute tasks** - Review and execute pending tickets

## Work with Specialists

Agent deployment follows modular design for specialized functionality. Commands usually deploy these automatically, but you can work with them directly when needed.

### Available Specialists
1. **Deploy project optimizer to analyze codebases** - Get analysis and improvement recommendations
2. **Use agent creator to build new tools** - Build specialized tools for specific needs
3. **Apply delegation advisor to route tasks** - Get help planning task distribution
4. **View agent architect for gold standard structure** - See how well-structured agents should look

### Learning About Specialists
1. **Read the agents documentation to understand architecture** - Get complete agent documentation
2. **Study the agent definition guide for structure** - Learn agent architecture principles
3. **Use the agent template to create new agents** - Follow the standard template
4. **Browse components for modular templates** - Find reusable agent components

### Important Rule
**Read the agents-only rule** - The agents directory contains ONLY agent files, nothing else

## Apply Templates

Templates follow formatting standards to create consistent structure across all documents.

### Use the command template to create new commands

Create standardized commands that follow the established patterns.
