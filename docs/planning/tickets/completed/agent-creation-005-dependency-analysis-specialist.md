# Ticket: Create Dependency Analysis Specialist Agent

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [agent-definition.md](../principles/agent-definition.md) by creating systematic interdependency mapping capability and applies [engineering.md](../principles/engineering.md) for comprehensive system analysis and impact assessment.

## Problem

Critical capability gap for system interdependency mapping and comprehensive dependency analysis. Current system lacks specialized expertise for dependency tracking, impact analysis, and system mapping across complex framework architectures.

**Specific Issues**:
- System interdependency mapping requires specialized analysis without dedicated dependency tracking expertise
- No dedicated agent for dependency tracking, impact analysis, and comprehensive system mapping
- Manual dependency analysis creates gaps and limits systematic impact assessment capability
- Lack of standardized approach to dependency management affecting system architecture decisions

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects all system architecture decisions, change impact analysis, and dependency management across framework
- **Users**: Development team blocked on comprehensive dependency analysis and system impact assessment capabilities
- **Severity**: HIGH - Essential capability for maintaining system integrity and informed architectural decisions

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Enables systematic dependency tracking and comprehensive impact analysis across framework architecture
2. Provides foundation for informed system architecture decisions based on dependency mapping
3. Establishes reliable dependency management methodology for ongoing framework evolution

## Solution

Create a specialized Dependency Analysis Specialist agent with comprehensive capabilities for dependency tracking, impact analysis implementation, and system mapping creation. Agent will handle systematic analysis of system interdependencies while providing actionable insights for architectural decisions.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze existing system architecture to understand current dependency patterns
   - Review framework interdependency requirements and impact analysis standards
   - Study current dependency tracking processes to identify systematic analysis gaps

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create agent definition with specialized dependency analysis methodology
   - Implement dependency tracking and system mapping capabilities
   - Develop impact analysis logic providing actionable architectural insights
   - Design systematic dependency validation and management processes

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Test agent capabilities against existing system architecture and dependency scenarios
   - Verify compliance with engineering principles and system analysis standards
   - Validate integration with development workflows and architectural decision processes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Agent successfully maps system interdependencies and identifies critical dependency relationships
- [x] Impact analysis provides actionable insights for architectural decisions and change management
- [x] System mapping creates comprehensive dependency visualization following engineering standards
- [x] Agent integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows and architectural processes
- [x] All implementation follows agent-definition.md standards and template structure

## Dependencies

- Reference to [agent-definition.md](../principles/agent-definition.md) for agent creation standards
- Framework system architecture standards and dependency management requirements
