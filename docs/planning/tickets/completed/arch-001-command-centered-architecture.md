# ARCH-001: Implement Command-Centered Architecture Integration

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Completion Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Total Effort**: 8 hours  
**Impact Level**: MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL TRANSFORMATION

## Problem Statement

The system operated with a fragmented architecture where:
- User requests went through main assistant to multiple disconnected systems
- Commands served as simple task executors without integration
- Principles were applied externally rather than embedded
- Agent deployment was handled separately from command execution
- Quality gates were inconsistent across different workflows

## Solution Implemented

Successfully transformed the architecture from:
```
User Request → Main Assistant → Multiple Systems
```

To:
```
User Request → Command → Integrated Execution Environment
```
