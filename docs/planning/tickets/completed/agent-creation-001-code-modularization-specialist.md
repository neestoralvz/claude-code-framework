# Ticket: Create Code Modularization Specialist Agent

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [agent-definition.md](../principles/agent-definition.md) by creating a specialized capability for code organization and applies [simplicity.md](../principles/simplicity.md) for reducing file complexity violations.

## Problem

Critical gap in agent capabilities for handling oversized command files and systematic code modularization. Current system lacks specialized expertise for breaking down large files into manageable components while maintaining architectural integrity.

**Specific Issues**:
- AUDIT-SIMP tickets require specialized modularization expertise not available in current agent roster
- Oversized command files violate simplicity principles without systematic reduction capability
- No dedicated agent for component extraction and modular architecture design
- Manual file size analysis and component identification creates bottlenecks

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects all oversized files across commands, agents, and documentation requiring modular breakdown
- **Users**: Development team blocked on simplicity compliance and code organization tasks
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core infrastructure requirement for maintaining framework standards

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Enables systematic resolution of 5+ pending AUDIT-SIMP tickets currently blocked on modularization expertise
2. Provides foundation for automated file complexity reduction and component extraction workflows
3. Establishes reusable patterns for maintaining optimal file sizes across framework evolution

## Solution

Create a specialized Code Modularization Specialist agent with comprehensive capabilities for file size analysis, component extraction, and modular architecture design. Agent will handle systematic breakdown of oversized files while preserving functionality and maintaining framework compliance.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze existing AUDIT-SIMP tickets to identify specific modularization requirements
   - Review framework standards for file size limits and component organization patterns
   - Study current oversized files to understand common complexity patterns

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create agent definition with specialized modularization methodology
   - Implement file size analysis and complexity assessment capabilities
   - Develop component extraction strategies maintaining functional integrity
   - Design modular architecture patterns for different file types

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Test agent capabilities against existing oversized file scenarios
   - Verify compliance with simplicity and organization principles
   - Validate integration with ticket execution and audit workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agent successfully analyzes file complexity and identifies optimal breakdown strategies
- [ ] Component extraction maintains full functionality while reducing file size below framework limits
- [ ] Modular architecture designs follow established framework patterns and principles
- [ ] Agent integrates seamlessly with existing ticket execution and audit workflows
- [ ] All implementation follows agent-definition.md standards and template structure

## Dependencies

- Reference to [agent-definition.md](../principles/agent-definition.md) for agent creation standards
- Analysis of pending AUDIT-SIMP tickets to understand specific capability requirements
- Framework file size limits and organization standards from simplicity principles

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `agents/code-modularization-specialist.md` - Complete agent definition with modularization expertise

**Principle Violations Addressed**:
- Resolves [simplicity.md](../principles/simplicity.md) violations by providing systematic file size reduction capability
- Supports [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) through structured modular architecture design

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase modularization execution
- Supports [engineering.md](../principles/engineering.md) by maintaining technical quality during component extraction
- Enables [task-orchestration.md](../principles/task-orchestration.md) for complex multi-file modularization projects

**Agent Capabilities Required**:
- File complexity analysis and metrics calculation
- Component identification and extraction logic
- Modular architecture design and validation
- Cross-reference preservation during file splitting
- Framework compliance verification for modularized components

**Integration Points**:

- System Audit frameworks for automated complexity detection
- Validation systems for post-modularization quality assurance

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduction of oversized files to framework-compliant sizes
- Preservation of functionality across component boundaries
- Maintainable modular architecture following established patterns
- Seamless integration with existing development workflows
