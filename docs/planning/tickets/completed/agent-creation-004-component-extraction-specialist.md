# Ticket: Create Component Extraction Specialist Agent

⏺ **Principle**: This ticket implements [agent-definition.md](../principles/agent-definition.md) by creating systematic component identification capability and applies [simplicity.md](../principles/simplicity.md) for large file breakdown and modular design.

## Problem

Critical capability gap for systematic large file breakdown and component creation. Current system lacks specialized expertise for component identification, extraction logic, and modular design implementation across complex codebases.

**Specific Issues**:
- Large file breakdown requires systematic component identification without specialized extraction expertise
- No dedicated agent for extraction logic, modular design, and component architecture
- Manual component identification creates inconsistency and limits systematic breakdown capability
- Lack of standardized approach to component extraction affecting modular architecture quality

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects all large file breakdown operations, component creation, and modular architecture implementation
- **Users**: Development team blocked on systematic component extraction and modular design capabilities
- **Severity**: HIGH - Essential capability for maintaining framework scalability and code organization

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Enables systematic component identification and extraction from complex large files
2. Provides foundation for consistent modular design implementation across framework evolution
3. Establishes reusable component extraction methodology for ongoing code organization

## Solution

Create a specialized Component Extraction Specialist agent with comprehensive capabilities for component identification, extraction logic implementation, and modular design creation. Agent will handle systematic breakdown of large files while maintaining architectural integrity.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze existing large file structures to understand common component patterns
   - Review framework modular design standards and component organization requirements
   - Study current file breakdown processes to identify extraction methodology gaps

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create agent definition with specialized component extraction methodology
   - Implement component identification and boundary analysis capabilities
   - Develop extraction logic maintaining functional integrity and architectural patterns
   - Design modular component organization following framework standards

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Test agent capabilities against existing large file breakdown scenarios
   - Verify compliance with simplicity principles and modular design standards
   - Validate integration with development workflows and quality assurance processes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Agent successfully identifies optimal component boundaries in large files while preserving functionality
- [ ] Component extraction maintains architectural integrity and follows established modular design patterns
- [ ] Extraction logic creates reusable, maintainable components following framework standards
- [ ] Agent integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows and validation processes
- [ ] All implementation follows agent-definition.md standards and template structure

## Dependencies

- Reference to [agent-definition.md](../principles/agent-definition.md) for agent creation standards
- Framework modular design standards and component organization requirements
- Simplicity principles for file size limits and complexity management
