# Ticket: Communication Principle Violations - Non-Imperative Language

## Problem

System scan detected 57 instances of non-imperative language across 24 files, violating the communication.md principle requiring direct, imperative tone.

**Specific Issues**:
- 57 total occurrences of should/would/could/might/may/perhaps/maybe
- Multiple files affected across docs, commands, and agents
- Inconsistent with established imperative communication standard
- Previous ticket (sys-011) addressed this but new instances emerged

## Impact

- **Scope**: Documentation clarity and consistency
- **Users**: All framework users and developers
- **Severity**: HIGH - Reduces clarity and violates communication standards

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Creates ambiguity in instructions and requirements
2. Violates communication.md imperative tone requirement
3. Reduces user confidence in directive clarity
4. Inconsistent with framework's direct communication style

## Solution

Systematically replace all non-imperative language with direct, imperative equivalents following communication.md patterns.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Systematic Detection**
   - Generate complete list of violations by file
   - Categorize by severity and context
   - Prioritize based on user impact

2. **Content Revision**
   - Replace "should" with direct imperatives ("Use", "Apply", "Execute")
   - Replace "would/could" with definitive statements
   - Replace "might/may" with clear conditions or requirements
   - Eliminate hedging language ("perhaps", "maybe")

3. **Validation and Testing**
   - Verify no non-imperative language remains
   - Ensure clarity and readability maintained
   - Validate cross-reference integrity

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Zero instances of should/would/could/might/may/perhaps/maybe
- [ ] All instructions use imperative tone
- [ ] Clarity and readability maintained or improved
- [ ] Cross-references remain functional

## Dependencies

None - Independent content revision work

## Notes

This builds on previous work in sys-011 but addresses new instances that have emerged. Focus on maintaining the framework's established direct, clear communication style.

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Review and revise all 24 affected files
- Apply imperative tone patterns consistently
- Document revision approach for future prevention

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates communication.md by using non-imperative language
- Violates fundamental.md by reducing instruction clarity
