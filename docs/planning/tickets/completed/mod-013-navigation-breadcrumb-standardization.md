# Ticket MOD-013: Create Standardized Navigation Breadcrumb Component

## Problem
Navigation breadcrumb patterns show 90% standardization opportunity across multiple documentation files. Current breadcrumb implementations are manually crafted with inconsistent formatting, leading to maintenance overhead and navigation inconsistencies.

## Impact
- **Scope**: All documentation files with navigation breadcrumbs
- **Users**: All documentation users and contributors
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Navigation consistency affects user experience
- **Standardization Opportunity**: 90% pattern consistency achievable

## Solution
Develop comprehensive navigation breadcrumb component system with automated generation capabilities and consistent formatting standards to eliminate manual breadcrumb maintenance.

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze existing breadcrumb patterns across all documentation
2. Extract common navigation structure and hierarchy patterns
3. Create reusable breadcrumb component template
4. Implement automated breadcrumb generation based on file location
5. Standardize breadcrumb formatting and link patterns
6. Update all documentation files to use component system
7. Add validation to ensure breadcrumb consistency
8. Document breadcrumb usage and customization options

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Standardized breadcrumb component created in docs/components/
- [ ] Automated breadcrumb generation implemented
- [ ] All documentation files use consistent breadcrumb patterns
- [ ] Breadcrumb formatting follows established standards
- [ ] Navigation hierarchy properly reflects file structure
- [ ] Component supports customization for special cases
- [ ] 90% standardization achieved across all breadcrumbs
- [ ] Documentation includes usage guidelines and examples

## Dependencies
- Requires understanding of current file hierarchy structure
- Must coordinate with navigation standardization efforts
- Depends on component infrastructure being in place

## Files Affected
- All .md files with navigation breadcrumbs (~25+ files)
- docs/components/navigation-breadcrumb.md (new)
- docs/components/breadcrumb-generator.sh (new)
- scripts/update-breadcrumbs.sh (new)

## Implementation Metrics
- **Navigation Files**: ~25+ files with breadcrumb patterns
- **Standardization Rate**: 90% consistency achieved
- **Maintenance Reduction**: Eliminates manual breadcrumb updates
- **User Experience**: Consistent navigation across all documentation

## Notes
This ticket addresses critical navigation standardization identified in modularization analysis. High impact on user experience and documentation maintainability.
