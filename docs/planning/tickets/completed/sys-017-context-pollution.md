# Ticket: Fix Context Pollution (Tools Positioned as Principles)

## Problem

Conceptual confusion exists between principles (philosophical framework) and tools/components (implementation details), creating context pollution that undermines the clear separation documented in the system architecture.

**Context Pollution Issues Identified**:

1. **Tool-Level Content in Principles Directory**:
   - Principles directory contains implementation-specific content
   - Detailed formatting rules mixed with philosophical guidance
   - Technical patterns positioned as fundamental principles

2. **Component Content Misclassified as Principles**:
   - Complex template patterns listed as principles
   - Implementation details elevated to principle status
   - Tools and patterns confused with foundational concepts

3. **Architectural Boundary Violations**:
   - docs/components/README.md clearly separates principles vs components
   - Current practice violates this documented separation
   - Principles become polluted with non-essential implementation details

4. **Cognitive Load Increase**:
   - Users must parse through tool details to understand principles
   - Core philosophy obscured by implementation specifics
   - System becomes harder to understand and apply

## Impact

- **Scope**: Conceptual clarity and system architecture integrity
- **Users**: All developers learning and applying the framework
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Creates conceptual confusion and reduces framework effectiveness

**Specific Issues**:
1. **Conceptual Confusion**: Users struggle to distinguish core principles from tools
2. **Framework Dilution**: Principles lose clarity when mixed with implementation
3. **Learning Difficulty**: New users overwhelmed by tool details in principle documents
4. **Maintenance Complexity**: Mixed concerns create harder maintenance burden

## Solution

Clarify separation between principles and tools throughout system:

1. **Audit Principle Content**: Identify tool-level content in principles directory
2. **Relocate Implementation Details**: Move tools and templates to appropriate locations
3. **Strengthen Principle Focus**: Ensure principles contain only philosophical framework
4. **Improve Architectural Clarity**: Reinforce documented separation boundaries

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit Content Classification**
   - Review all files in `/docs/principles/` for tool-level content
   - Identify implementation details masquerading as principles
   - Document current boundary violations

2. **Separate Principles from Tools**
   - **Principles Should Contain**: Core philosophy, fundamental concepts, "WHY" and "WHAT"
   - **Components Should Contain**: Implementation patterns, templates, "HOW"
   - Relocate misclassified content to appropriate directories

3. **Strengthen Principle Documents**
   - Focus principles on fundamental concepts and methodology
   - Remove detailed implementation instructions from principles
   - Ensure principles are universal and rarely changing

4. **Enhance Component System**
   - Move implementation patterns to components directory
   - Create clear component categories for different tool types
   - Establish component composition patterns

5. **Update Cross-References**
   - Fix references that blur principle/component boundaries
   - Ensure links accurately describe target content type
   - Strengthen architectural documentation

6. **Validate Conceptual Clarity**
   - Test framework understanding with clear principle/tool separation
   - Verify each directory contains appropriate content type
   - Confirm architectural boundaries are respected

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All principle documents contain only fundamental philosophy and concepts
- [ ] No implementation details or tool instructions in principles directory
- [ ] Clear separation between "WHY/WHAT" (principles) and "HOW" (components)
- [ ] Components directory contains all implementation patterns and tools
- [ ] Cross-references accurately distinguish between principles and tools
- [ ] Framework architecture boundaries clearly respected
- [ ] Conceptual clarity improved for new users
- [ ] System easier to understand and apply

## Dependencies

None - this is a content organization and clarity task that can be completed independently.

## Notes

Generated from medium-priority system audit finding. Clear conceptual separation is critical for framework usability and maintainability.

**Principle vs Component Separation** (from docs/components/README.md):

**Principles** (/docs/principles/):
- Define philosophical framework (WHY and WHAT)
- Core concepts and methodology  
- Universal application across system
- Rarely change

**Components** (/docs/components/):
- Provide reusable implementations (HOW)
- Practical implementation patterns
- Prevent code duplication (DRY)
- Evolve with system needs

**Example Content Reclassification**:

**Should be Principles**:
- Core communication philosophy
- Fundamental organization concepts
- Basic workflow methodology
- Essential formatting philosophy

**Should be Components**:
- Specific template patterns
- Detailed formatting rules
- Implementation checklists
- Tool usage instructions

**Audit Questions for Content**:
1. Is this fundamental philosophy or implementation detail?
2. Does this answer "WHY/WHAT" or "HOW"?
3. Is this universal or context-specific?
4. Does this change rarely or evolve with needs?

**Files Requiring Review**:
- All files in `/docs/principles/` for tool-level content
- Cross-references between principles and components
- Navigation that might blur conceptual boundaries
- Documentation that positions tools as principles

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [organization.md] by mixing different content types
- Violates [fundamental.md] by obscuring core concepts with implementation
- Violates [communication.md] by creating unclear conceptual communication
