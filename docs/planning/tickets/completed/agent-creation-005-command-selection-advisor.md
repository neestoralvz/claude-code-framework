# Ticket: Create command-selection-advisor agent for intelligent command matching

## Problem

Missing core delegation functionality in command-centered architecture - no dedicated specialist agent exists to intelligently analyze user requests and recommend appropriate commands from the /commands/ folder (CLAUDE.md:67-70). This is critical infrastructure for the command-centered approach where proper command selection determines execution success.

## Impact

- **Scope**: Core delegation functionality for entire command-centered architecture
- **Users**: All Claude Code operations requiring command selection
- **Severity**: Critical - Command-centered architecture depends on intelligent command matching

## Solution

Create dedicated command-selection-advisor agent specializing in:
1. User request analysis and intent recognition
2. Command capability mapping and matching
3. Intelligent recommendation generation with confidence scoring
4. Command compatibility assessment and dependency validation

## Implementation Steps

1. **Agent Creation**: Create `/agents/project-management/coordination/command-selection-advisor.md`
2. **Capability Analysis**: Map all existing commands in `/commands/` folder with their specific capabilities
3. **Request Analysis Framework**: Implement user request parsing and intent classification
4. **Matching Algorithm**: Develop intelligent matching between user needs and command capabilities
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Build confidence-scored recommendation system
6. **Validation Framework**: Implement dependency checking and compatibility validation
7. **Integration Testing**: Validate agent integration with command execution workflow
8. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive usage patterns and examples

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] command-selection-advisor agent created in proper location
- [x] Agent analyzes user requests for intent and complexity
- [x] Agent maps requests to appropriate commands with confidence scores
- [x] Agent validates command dependencies and compatibility
- [x] Agent provides clear command recommendations with reasoning
- [x] Agent integrates seamlessly with command-centered delegation workflow
- [x] Agent follows established agent template and architecture patterns
- [x] Agent includes comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- [x] Agent handles edge cases (no matching command, multiple options, etc.)
- [x] Agent maintains updated command capability registry

## Completion Summary

**Agent Successfully Created**: `/agents/project-management/coordination/command-selection-advisor.md`

**Key Capabilities Implemented**:
- Intelligent request analysis with intent recognition and complexity assessment
- Advanced command matching algorithm with 4-criteria scoring system (100-point scale)
- Comprehensive command registry covering all 25+ framework commands
- Intelligent recommendation engine with confidence scoring and alternatives
- Edge case handling for no matches, multiple options, and complex requests
- Full integration with command-centered architecture and Claude Code framework

**Technical Implementation**:
- 4-gate validation system with comprehensive completion checklist
- Structured output format with clear recommendation rationale
- Registry maintenance capabilities for command capability tracking
- Performance monitoring and continuous improvement protocols

**Impact**: Provides critical command-selection intelligence missing from command-centered architecture, enabling intelligent automation and improved delegation efficiency.

## Dependencies

- Understanding of all commands in `/commands/` folder structure
- Analysis of command capabilities and specializations
- Integration with existing command-centered architecture patterns
- Alignment with agent-selection principles and delegation logic

## Notes

This agent fills a critical gap in the command-centered architecture where intelligent command selection is essential for proper delegation. The agent should maintain an up-to-date understanding of all available commands and their specific capabilities to make optimal recommendations for any user request.

Priority: HIGH (P2) - Core delegation functionality missing for command-centered architecture success.
