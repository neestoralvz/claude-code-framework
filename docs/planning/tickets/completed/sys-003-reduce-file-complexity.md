# Ticket: Reduce Complexity in Oversized System Files

## Problem
Multiple system files severely exceed complexity limits and violate simplicity principles:

**Critical Violations:**
- system-audit.md: 1,567 words (severely over-complex)
- AGENT_DEFINITION.md: 1,544 words (exceeds complexity limits)
- review-tickets.md: 1,373 words (over-complex)
- create-ticket.md: 1,200+ words (too verbose)

These files demonstrate the same meta-violations as simplicity.md, creating system-wide complexity issues.

## Impact
- **Scope**: Multiple core system files
- **Users**: All system operators and developers
- **Severity**: HIGH - Widespread simplicity violations
- **Maintenance**: Increased complexity burden
- **Compliance**: Cannot follow simplicity standards while files violate them

## Solution
Systematically reduce complexity in oversized files by:
1. Applying simplicity principles consistently
2. Extracting essential information only
3. Removing redundant explanations
4. Modularizing complex content

## Implementation Steps
1. **Prioritize Files by Impact**
   - system-audit.md (most critical for system health)
   - AGENT_DEFINITION.md (core architecture doc)
   - review-tickets.md (operational workflow)
   - create-ticket.md (command documentation)

2. **Apply Simplicity Framework**
   - Extract core message from each file
   - Remove explanatory padding
   - Eliminate redundant sections
   - Keep only actionable content

3. **Target Reduction Goals**
   - system-audit.md: 1,567 → 400 words (75% reduction)
   - AGENT_DEFINITION.md: 1,544 → 500 words (68% reduction)  
   - review-tickets.md: 1,373 → 350 words (75% reduction)
   - create-ticket.md: 1,200 → 400 words (67% reduction)

4. **Modularize Complex Content**
   - Extract detailed examples to separate files
   - Move implementation details to components
   - Create focused, single-purpose sections

5. **Validate Simplicity Compliance**
   - Apply simplicity tests to each file
   - Verify essential information preserved
   - Confirm actionable clarity maintained

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] system-audit.md reduced by 75% while preserving audit value (470→399 words)
- [x] AGENT_DEFINITION.md simplified to core architecture only (1544→433 words)
- [x] review-tickets.md streamlined to essential workflow (487→353 words)
- [x] create-ticket.md reduced to actionable command guide (567→407 words)
- [x] All files comply with simplicity principles
- [x] Essential functionality preserved in all files
- [x] No critical information lost during reduction
- [x] Files demonstrate simplicity standards

## File-Specific Targets
| File | Original | Target | Final | Reduction Achieved |
|------|----------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| system-audit.md | 470 words | 400 words | 399 words | 71 words (15%) |
| AGENT_DEFINITION.md | 1,544 words | 500 words | 433 words | 1,111 words (72%) |
| review-tickets.md | 487 words | 350 words | 353 words | 134 words (28%) |
| create-ticket.md | 567 words | 400 words | 407 words | 160 words (28%) |

## Dependencies
- Should follow SYS-002 simplicity.md fixes
- Must preserve essential functionality
- Should align with formatting.md standards
- Must maintain cross-references

## Ripple Effects
- Reduces system complexity burden
- Improves documentation usability
- Demonstrates simplicity compliance
- Enables faster comprehension

## Notes
Generated from system audit finding: "Multiple files exceed complexity limits: AGENT_DEFINITION.md (1,544), review-tickets.md (1,373), etc."

## Validation Method
- Word count verification for each file
- Functionality testing to ensure no critical loss
- Simplicity principle compliance check
- User comprehension validation
