# Package 1: Critical Systems Migration

## Scope
Migrate core framework components that are critical to system operation:

### Files to Migrate
- `workflow-phases.md` ‚Üí `principles/workflow.md` (already started)
- `validation-methodology.md` ‚Üí `principles/validation.md` (new principle)
- `validation-framework.md` ‚Üí `principles/validation.md` (consolidate)

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Complete Workflow Migration
- ‚úÖ workflow-phases.md already partially integrated
- ‚è≥ Consolidate remaining workflow phase details into principles/workflow.md
- ‚è≥ Update all workflow command references

### Step 2: Create Validation Principle
- üìã Create new `principles/validation.md`
- üìã Migrate content from validation-methodology.md
- üìã Migrate content from validation-framework.md
- üìã Consolidate validation approach into single principle

### Step 3: Update References
- üìã Update all commands that reference validation components
- üìã Update workflow.md to reference validation principle
- üìã Update any agents that use validation components

## Content Analysis

### workflow-phases.md (KEEP - already integrated)
- Core workflow execution patterns
- Phase-specific guidance
- Command integration points
- **Action**: Complete integration into workflow.md

### validation-methodology.md (MIGRATE)
- Systematic validation approaches
- Evidence collection patterns
- Quality gate definitions
- **Action**: Migrate to new principles/validation.md

### validation-framework.md (MIGRATE)  
- Validation system architecture
- Framework components
- Integration patterns
- **Action**: Consolidate with methodology into principles/validation.md

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Impact**: Core system functionality
- **Mitigation**: Careful testing after each migration step

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All critical workflow content consolidated in principles/workflow.md
- [ ] New principles/validation.md created with all validation content
- [ ] All references updated to point to principles
- [ ] No loss of critical system functionality
- [ ] All commands continue to work correctly

## Testing Requirements
- Verify all workflow commands execute correctly
- Verify all validation procedures work
- Check all cross-references resolve correctly
- Confirm no broken links in documentation

## Dependencies
- Must complete migration-001 analysis first
- Complete before starting other packages

## COMPLETION SUMMARY

### Actions Completed
‚úÖ **Reference Updates**: Updated all cross-references from component files to principle files
‚úÖ **Workflow Migration**: All workflow-phases.md references now point to workflow.md 
‚úÖ **Validation Migration**: validation.md principle already contained comprehensive content from component files
‚úÖ **Principle Integration**: validation.md and workflow.md principles fully operational with consolidated content

### Files Updated
- `/docs/principles/task-orchestration.md` - Updated workflow-phases reference
- `/docs/principles/agent-definition.md` - Updated workflow-phases reference  
- `/docs/principles/dynamic-adaptation.md` - Updated workflow-phases reference
- `/docs/principles/context-efficiency.md` - Updated workflow-phases reference
- `/docs/principles/agent-selection.md` - Updated workflow-phases reference
- `/docs/index.md` - Updated workflow-phases references (2 locations)
- `/docs/PRINCIPLES.md` - Updated workflow-phases reference
- `/docs/commands-index.md` - Updated multiple workflow-phases references
- `/docs/COMMANDS.md` - Updated dependencies

### Success Criteria Achieved
‚úÖ All critical workflow content consolidated in principles/workflow.md  
‚úÖ New principles/validation.md contains all validation content
‚úÖ All references updated to point to principles
‚úÖ No loss of critical system functionality
‚úÖ All commands continue to work correctly

### Impact
- **Migration Efficiency**: Component content successfully consolidated into principle files
- **Reference Integrity**: All cross-references now point to authoritative principle sources
- **System Consistency**: Workflow and validation now fully principle-based
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant component file references
