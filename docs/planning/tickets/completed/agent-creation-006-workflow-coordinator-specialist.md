# Ticket: Create Workflow-Coordinator Agent for 8-Phase Methodology Orchestration

⏺ **Principle**: This ticket implements [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) by creating systematic orchestration capability for complete 8-phase methodology execution through specialized agent deployment patterns.

## Problem

The Claude Code framework lacks a specialized agent for orchestrating complete 8-phase workflow execution, creating a critical gap in systematic task management capabilities.

**Specific Issues**:
- Missing coordinator for end-to-end workflow orchestration across all 8 phases
- No systematic agent for managing phase transitions and validation points
- Framework operates with individual phase agents but lacks comprehensive coordination
- CLAUDE.md:54 identifies need for systematic workflow management specialist

## Impact

- **Scope**: Core framework capability affecting all task execution workflows
- **Users**: All system operators requiring systematic 8-phase methodology execution
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Core framework functionality missing for systematic task coordination

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Framework cannot execute complete systematic workflows without manual coordination
2. Quality assurance gaps in phase transitions and validation points
3. Inconsistent workflow execution patterns across different task types
4. Reduced framework effectiveness for complex multi-phase operations

## Solution

Create a comprehensive workflow-coordinator agent specializing in 8-phase methodology orchestration with built-in validation, phase management, and systematic execution capabilities.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Complete 8-phase workflow orchestration from clarification through validation
- Intelligent phase transition management with built-in quality gates
- Recursive operation support for continuous improvement cycles
- Integration with existing agent ecosystem and Task tool framework

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze workflow.md methodology for complete 8-phase implementation requirements
   - Study existing phase-specific agents to understand coordination patterns
   - Map integration points with Task tool and command architecture

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create workflow-coordinator agent following established agent creation patterns
   - Implement 8-phase orchestration logic with embedded validation framework
   - Design intelligent phase transition management with quality gates
   - Build recursive operation support for continuous improvement

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Test complete workflow execution across diverse task types
   - Verify integration with existing agent ecosystem and Task tool
   - Validate systematic execution patterns against framework principles
   - Confirm orchestration capabilities meet CLAUDE.md requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow-coordinator agent created following established agent creation patterns
- [ ] Agent implements complete 8-phase methodology orchestration (clarify → explore → analyze → present → plan → implement → ripple → validate)
- [ ] Built-in validation framework with quality gates at each phase transition
- [ ] Recursive operation support for continuous improvement cycles
- [ ] Integration with Task tool for deployment and execution
- [ ] Systematic execution patterns validated across multiple task types
- [ ] Agent available for immediate deployment in framework operations
- [ ] Documentation complete with clear capability specifications and usage examples

## Dependencies

- Understanding of [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) 8-phase methodology
- Familiarity with existing agent creation patterns in agents/ directory
- Access to Task tool integration framework for agent deployment
- Knowledge of command-centered architecture for systematic execution

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `agents/workflow-coordinator.md` - Primary agent implementation with comprehensive orchestration capabilities

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) through complete 8-phase execution orchestration
- Supports [task-orchestration.md](../../principles/task-orchestration.md) by providing systematic coordination patterns
- Implements [agent-selection.md](../../principles/agent-selection.md) through intelligent agent deployment within workflow phases

**Critical Requirements**:
- Must handle complete workflow lifecycle from initial clarification through final validation
- Must provide intelligent phase transition management with quality assurance
- Must support recursive operations for continuous improvement and quality enhancement
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing command-centered architecture patterns

**Success Validation**:
- Agent successfully orchestrates complete 8-phase workflows for diverse task types
- Phase transitions occur systematically with appropriate validation checkpoints
- Recursive operations function correctly for quality improvement cycles
- Integration with Task tool enables immediate deployment and execution

**Priority Justification**:
CRITICAL priority assigned due to:
- Core framework capability missing for systematic task execution
- Required for complete implementation of CLAUDE.md operational directives
- Foundational component for systematic workflow management across all operations
- Enables consistent quality assurance through systematic execution patterns
