# CONSOLIDATION-006: Standardize Workflow Definitions

## üü° MEDIUM Priority | Category: consolidation | Est. Effort: 2h

[Previous: View circular references ticket](consolidation-005-circular-references.md) | [Return to registry dashboard](../../TICKET_REGISTRY.md) | [Next: View low priority consolidation tickets](../../TICKET_REGISTRY.md#-low-priority-pending)

## Problem Statement

System audit identified multiple competing workflow definitions throughout the framework, with the 8-phase workflow pattern defined inconsistently across different files. This creates confusion about proper workflow implementation and undermines systematic task execution.

### Critical Issues Identified
- **Multiple workflow definitions** across different files
- **Inconsistent 8-phase descriptions** with varying interpretations
- **Competing workflow guidance** causing implementation confusion
- **Maintenance overhead** from distributed workflow documentation
- **Framework inconsistency** undermining systematic execution

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
- [ ] **Single Workflow Source**: Authoritative 8-phase workflow in one location
- [ ] **Definition Consolidation**: All workflow definitions reference single source
- [ ] **Implementation Consistency**: Unified workflow application across framework
- [ ] **Reference Updates**: All workflow references point to authoritative source
- [ ] **Documentation Cleanup**: Remove redundant workflow documentation

### Validation Gates
1. **Workflow Definition Scan**: Single authoritative workflow definition exists
2. **Reference Validation**: All workflow references point to authoritative source
3. **Implementation Validation**: Consistent workflow application across framework
4. **Integration Validation**: All components use unified workflow approach
5. **Documentation Validation**: Clear workflow implementation guidance

## Technical Analysis

### Current Workflow Definition Locations
Based on system audit findings:

#### Primary Definition Location
- `/docs/principles/workflow.md` - Main 8-phase workflow definition

#### Competing/Redundant Definitions
- `/docs/index.md` - Alternative workflow guidance
- `/commands/workflow/` - Command-specific workflow variations
- Agent files with workflow implementation variations
- Various documentation files with workflow references

### 8-Phase Workflow Standard
**Authoritative sequence** (from workflow.md):
1. **Clarification** - Requirement understanding
2. **Exploration** - Context gathering
3. **Analysis** - Solution evaluation
4. **Solution** - Implementation planning
5. **Planning** - Execution preparation
6. **Implementation** - Solution execution
7. **Validation** - Quality verification
8. **Reporting** - Results documentation

### Impact Assessment
- **Workflow Consistency**: HIGH - Unified workflow implementation
- **Framework Reliability**: MEDIUM - Consistent systematic execution
- **Maintenance**: HIGH - Centralized workflow management
- **User Experience**: HIGH - Clear workflow guidance

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Workflow Audit (0.5h)
- Scan all files for workflow definitions
- Document workflow variations and locations
- Map workflow reference network
- Identify conflicting workflow interpretations

### Phase 2: Definition Consolidation (0.75h)
- Validate `docs/principles/workflow.md` as authoritative source
- Remove competing workflow definitions
- Ensure comprehensive workflow documentation in authoritative source
- Update workflow implementation guidance

### Phase 3: Reference Updates (0.5h)
- Update all workflow references to point to authoritative source
- Replace competing definitions with references
- Standardize workflow reference format
- Update cross-references and navigation

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (0.25h)
- Verify single workflow definition exists
- Test workflow implementation consistency
- Validate all workflow references work correctly
- Confirm systematic execution standards

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Implementation Gaps**: Ensure all workflow aspects covered in authoritative source
- **Reference Breaks**: Validate all workflow references after updates
- **Integration Issues**: Test framework operation with unified workflow

### Process Risks
- **Workflow Confusion**: Provide clear implementation guidance
- **Documentation Gaps**: Ensure comprehensive workflow documentation
- **Training Issues**: Update guidance for unified workflow approach

## Dependencies

### Blocked By
- System audit completion (‚úÖ Complete)
- Workflow analysis (‚úÖ Complete from audit)

### Blocks
- Systematic execution standardization
- Workflow implementation improvements

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files with Workflow Definitions
- `/docs/index.md` - Remove competing workflow guidance
- `/commands/workflow/` - Standardize command workflow references
- Agent files with workflow variations
- Documentation files with workflow references

### Authoritative Source Enhancement
- `/docs/principles/workflow.md` - Validate comprehensive 8-phase documentation
- Ensure detailed implementation guidance
- Add clear workflow application examples
- Include integration patterns

## Quality Assurance

### Engineering Standards
- ‚è∫ **Principle**: Apply [engineering.md](../../principles/engineering.md) for technical quality
- ‚è∫ **Principle**: Follow [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) as authoritative source
- ‚è∫ **Principle**: Use [communication.md](../../principles/communication.md) for clear workflow instructions

### Validation Framework
- Workflow definition scanning automation
- Implementation consistency testing
- Reference integrity validation
- Systematic execution testing

## Workflow Implementation Matrix

| Component Type | Workflow Application | Reference Pattern |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Agents | Full 8-phase implementation | Reference workflow.md for systematic execution |
| Commands | Phase-specific implementation | Reference workflow.md for context |
| Documentation | Workflow guidance references | Reference workflow.md for methodology |
| Templates | Workflow-based structure | Reference workflow.md for organization |

## Completion Evidence

### Deliverables
1. **Workflow Audit Report**: Documentation of all definitions consolidated
2. **Authoritative Source**: Enhanced workflow.md with comprehensive guidance
3. **Reference Update Log**: All workflow references redirected
4. **Implementation Guide**: Unified workflow application documentation
5. **Validation Report**: Confirmation of workflow standardization

### Success Metrics
- **1 authoritative workflow definition** in system
- **100% workflow references** point to workflow.md
- **0 competing definitions** detected
- **Consistent implementation** across all components
- **Clear workflow guidance** documented and functional

## Integration Points

### With 8-Phase Framework
- Maintains systematic execution standards
- Supports consistent framework operation
- Enables reliable task completion

### With Component Architecture
- Provides unified workflow approach for all components
- Supports systematic agent and command operation
- Enables consistent documentation patterns
