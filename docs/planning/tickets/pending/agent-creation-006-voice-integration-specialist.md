**Specific Issues**:
- SuperWhisper prompt optimization requires specialized voice workflow expertise not available in current agent roster
- No dedicated agent for voice prompt design, transcription optimization, and workflow integration
- Manual voice workflow management creates inefficiency and limits systematic optimization capability
- Lack of standardized approach to voice integration affecting development workflow efficiency

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects all voice-based development workflows, transcription optimization, and SuperWhisper integration processes
- **Users**: Development team limited by inefficient voice workflows and suboptimal transcription integration
- **Severity**: HIGH - Essential capability for modern development workflow efficiency and voice-based productivity

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Enables systematic optimization of SuperWhisper prompts and voice workflow integration
2. Provides foundation for efficient transcription workflows and voice-based development processes
3. Establishes reusable voice integration methodology for ongoing workflow enhancement

## Solution
