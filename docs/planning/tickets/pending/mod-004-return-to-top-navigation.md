# Ticket MOD-004: Extract Return-to-Top Navigation

## Problem
Return-to-top navigation links ([⬆ Return to top]) are duplicated across 42 files with 85% similarity, requiring manual maintenance for anchor updates.

## Impact
- **Scope**: 42 files with return-to-top links
- **Users**: All documentation readers requiring quick navigation
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Inconsistent navigation affects user experience

## Solution
Extract return-to-top navigation pattern to reusable component with consistent formatting and anchor generation.

## Implementation Steps
1. Catalog all existing return-to-top link patterns
2. Create standardized navigation component in docs/components/
3. Define template for automatic anchor generation
4. Update all 42 files to use consistent pattern
5. Verify all return-to-top links function correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Template created for return-to-top navigation
- [ ] All 42 files use consistent return-to-top format
- [ ] Links automatically generate correct anchors
- [ ] All return-to-top links function properly
- [ ] Pattern is documented for future use

## Files Affected
- All files with [⬆ Return to top] links (42 files)
- Target template: docs/components/return-to-top-template.md
