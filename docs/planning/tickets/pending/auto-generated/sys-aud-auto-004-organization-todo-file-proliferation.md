# ORGANIZATION VIOLATION: TODO File Proliferation

**AUTO-GENERATED TICKET** by system-auditor during comprehensive audit

## Problem Description

The todos directory contains 89 individual TODO files, creating massive organizational complexity and making task tracking unmanageable.

## Violation Details
- **Directory**: `/todos/`
- **File count**: 89 files
- **Threshold**: 20 files maximum
- **Excess**: 69 files (345% over threshold)
- **Pattern**: UUID-based individual task files

## Impact Assessment
- Completely unmanageable task tracking system
- Violates organization principles
- Creates filesystem clutter
- Impossible to maintain oversight of pending tasks

## Resolution Strategy
1. Consolidate all TODO files into structured registry
2. Implement centralized task tracking system
3. Remove individual TODO files after consolidation
4. Establish task management workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All TODOs consolidated into central registry
- [ ] Individual TODO files removed
- [ ] Centralized task tracking system operational
- [ ] Clear task management workflows established
- [ ] Directory organization principles restored

## Priority Justification
**HIGH** - Complete breakdown of task organization system

## Related Components
- Task management system
- Directory organization standards
- Project tracking workflows
- Cleanup automation
