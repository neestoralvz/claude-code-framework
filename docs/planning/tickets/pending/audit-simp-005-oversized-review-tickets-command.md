# Ticket: Reduce review-tickets.md Command File Size to Meet Simplicity Standards

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) by reducing file complexity below the 250-line threshold through systematic modularization and component extraction.

## Problem

The review-tickets.md command file exceeds the simplicity principle threshold with 338 lines, violating the framework's core simplicity standards by 35% over the limit.

**Specific Issues**:
- Command file contains 338 lines (135% of 250-line limit)
- Complex ticket review strategies and prioritization frameworks embedded within command
- Extensive execution coordination patterns dilute core review functionality
- Multiple review modes and assessment criteria create cognitive overhead

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects ticket review command usability, maintainability, and framework compliance
- **Users**: All project managers and developers using ticket review for project coordination
- **Severity**: HIGH - Violates core framework principles and complicates ticket review adoption

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. File complexity obscures essential ticket review workflow execution
2. Violates simplicity.md principle requirement for focused, digestible commands
3. Creates maintenance burden for ticket review methodology updates

## Solution

Implement systematic modularization by extracting review strategies and prioritization frameworks to specialized components while preserving core ticket review workflow in simplified main command.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze current review-tickets.md structure and identify extractable components
   - Map essential ticket review workflow vs. strategy documentation
   - Design component extraction strategy maintaining review integrity

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Extract review strategies to separate component files
   - Reduce main command to essential ticket review execution
   - Create specialized components for prioritization frameworks
   - Implement cross-references to extracted components

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify simplified command maintains full review capability
   - Test component references and ensure seamless integration
   - Validate compliance with 250-line simplicity threshold

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] review-tickets.md file reduced to under 250 lines while maintaining functionality
- [ ] Review strategies extracted to appropriate component files
- [ ] Prioritization frameworks moved to specialized components
- [ ] No regression in ticket review capability or quality
- [ ] Full compliance with simplicity.md principle requirements

## Dependencies

- Reference to [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) for threshold requirements
- Reference to [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) for modular design patterns
- Component extraction following [modularization guidelines](../../docs/principles/organization.md)

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `commands/management/review-tickets.md` - Reduce to essential review workflow
- `docs/components/ticket-review-strategies.md` - Extract review strategies
- `docs/components/ticket-prioritization-framework.md` - Extract prioritization methods
- `docs/components/execution-coordination-patterns.md` - Extract coordination documentation

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) by exceeding 250-line complexity threshold
- Impacts [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by mixing command and strategy documentation

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase extraction
- Supports [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by implementing modular design patterns
