# Ticket: Eliminate Success Criteria Pattern Duplication Across Framework

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) by eliminating redundant success criteria patterns through systematic component extraction and centralization.

## Problem

Success criteria patterns are duplicated across 2,370 occurrences in 271 files, creating massive redundancy and maintenance overhead throughout the framework.

**Specific Issues**:
- 2,370 duplicate success criteria pattern occurrences across 271 files
- Inconsistent success criteria formatting and structure across components
- Maintenance burden requiring updates to hundreds of files for criteria changes
- Violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle causing framework bloat

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects entire framework maintainability and consistency
- **Users**: All developers and system operators working with success criteria
- **Severity**: HIGH - Creates massive maintenance overhead and inconsistency risk

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Changes to success criteria patterns require updates across 271 files
2. Inconsistent implementations lead to confusion and errors in validation
3. Framework bloat from redundant patterns impacts system performance and clarity

## Solution

Create centralized success criteria component templates and systematically replace duplicated patterns with standardized references across the entire framework.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze existing success criteria patterns to identify common structures
   - Create comprehensive success criteria component templates
   - Map all 271 files containing duplicated patterns for systematic replacement

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create centralized success criteria component templates
   - Implement standardized reference patterns for component inclusion
   - Systematically replace duplicated patterns across all affected files
   - Establish validation framework for success criteria consistency

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify all success criteria maintain functionality after centralization
   - Test component reference integrity across all updated files
   - Validate reduction in framework complexity and maintenance burden

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Centralized success criteria component templates created and standardized
- [ ] All 271 files updated to use centralized component references
- [ ] Success criteria duplication reduced by minimum 90% across framework
- [ ] Validation framework established for ongoing success criteria consistency
- [ ] No regression in success criteria functionality or clarity

## Dependencies

- Reference to [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) for complexity reduction requirements
- Reference to [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) for component standardization
- Success criteria validation following [engineering.md](../../principles/engineering.md)

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `docs/templates/components/success-criteria-template.md` - Central success criteria component
- `docs/templates/components/validation-criteria-patterns.md` - Validation pattern templates
- Update 271 files across commands/, agents/, docs/principles/ directories
- `docs/templates/components/success-criteria-usage-guide.md` - Implementation guidelines

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) through massive pattern duplication
- Impacts [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by failing to implement component reuse

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase execution
- Supports [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by implementing centralized component architecture
