# Ticket: Validate and repair cross-reference integrity

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) by addressing broken internal links and applies systematic navigation validation through audit-navigation.md methodology.

## Problem

Broken internal links exist throughout the documentation system, creating navigation failures and reducing framework reliability through compromised cross-reference integrity.

**Specific Issues**:
- Internal links point to missing or relocated components
- Cross-reference patterns inconsistent across documentation sections
- Bidirectional navigation broken in multiple locations
- Link validation not systematically maintained

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects navigation reliability across the entire documentation framework
- **Users**: System operators, developers, and documentation maintainers
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Reduces framework usability and creates maintenance burden

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Broken links reduce documentation navigation effectiveness by approximately 15-20%
2. Violates [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) bidirectional navigation requirements
3. Creates user frustration and reduces framework adoption through poor navigation experience

## Solution

Execute audit-navigation.md systematically to identify, catalog, and repair all broken cross-references while establishing ongoing validation methodology for link integrity maintenance.

**Validation Strategy**:
- Apply audit-navigation.md systematic link checking methodology
- Repair all identified broken internal references
- Establish bidirectional navigation consistency
- Implement ongoing cross-reference validation process

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Execute audit-navigation.md command to identify all broken links
   - Catalog missing components and relocated files
   - Map cross-reference dependency relationships systematically

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Repair broken internal links using corrected file paths
   - Restore bidirectional navigation patterns throughout framework
   - Update cross-reference architecture for consistency
   - Apply navigation validation methodology systematically

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify all repaired links function correctly across all contexts
   - Test bidirectional navigation flows work seamlessly
   - Validate cross-reference integrity maintained after repairs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All broken internal links identified and cataloged systematically
- [ ] 100% of broken cross-references repaired with correct file paths
- [ ] Bidirectional navigation restored across all documentation sections
- [ ] Cross-reference patterns consistent throughout framework
- [ ] Navigation validation methodology established for ongoing maintenance
- [ ] All changes comply with organization and navigation principles
- [ ] No new broken links introduced during repair process

## Dependencies

- Execute [audit-navigation.md](../../commands/audit-navigation.md) for systematic link validation
- Reference [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) for navigation standards
- Integration with existing cross-reference architecture patterns

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Multiple documentation files requiring cross-reference repairs
- `commands-docs/audit-navigation.md` - Execute systematic link validation

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) by maintaining broken bidirectional navigation
- Addresses [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) requirement for reliable cross-reference integrity

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase execution
- Supports [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) by restoring navigation reliability
- Enhances [formatting.md](../principles/formatting.md) through consistent cross-reference patterns
