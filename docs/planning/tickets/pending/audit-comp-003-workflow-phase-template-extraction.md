# Ticket: Extract Workflow Phase Template Patterns into Reusable Component System

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) by extracting repeated workflow phase patterns into reusable component templates for improved execution consistency.

## Problem

Workflow phase template patterns are duplicated across numerous commands throughout the framework, creating inconsistent workflow implementation and maintenance overhead.

**Specific Issues**:
- Inconsistent workflow phase structure across different commands
- Manual workflow implementation leads to missing phases or incorrect execution
- Duplicated workflow patterns violate DRY principle
- No standardized workflow validation enforcement across commands

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects framework workflow consistency and command execution reliability
- **Users**: All developers implementing commands with workflow phases
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Creates workflow inconsistency and execution reliability issues

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Inconsistent workflow implementations create unpredictable command behavior
2. Manual workflow maintenance leads to incomplete or incorrect phase execution
3. Duplicated patterns create unnecessary maintenance overhead and validation gaps

## Solution

Extract workflow phase patterns into a centralized, reusable component system with standardized templates for the 8-phase methodology and automated validation.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze existing workflow phase patterns to identify standardizable structures
   - Design standardized 8-phase workflow templates
   - Map commands requiring workflow standardization

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create centralized workflow phase template component system
   - Implement standardized 8-phase methodology templates
   - Replace manual workflow implementations with template references
   - Establish workflow validation framework

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify all workflows maintain accurate phase execution after component extraction
   - Test template system across different command types
   - Validate improved workflow consistency and completeness

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Centralized workflow phase template component system created
- [ ] Standardized 8-phase methodology templates implemented
- [ ] Manual workflow patterns replaced with template references
- [ ] Validation framework established for workflow phase accuracy
- [ ] Workflow execution consistency improved across framework

## Dependencies

- Reference to [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) for 8-phase methodology requirements
- Reference to [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) for component template patterns

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `docs/templates/components/workflow-phase-template-system.md` - Central template system
- `docs/templates/components/workflow-validation-framework.md` - Phase validation system
- `docs/templates/workflow/` - 8-phase methodology templates
- Various commands/ files for template integration

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase implementation
- Supports [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by implementing modular workflow design
