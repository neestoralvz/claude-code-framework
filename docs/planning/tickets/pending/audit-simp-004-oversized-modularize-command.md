# Ticket: Reduce modularize.md Command File Size to Meet Simplicity Standards

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) by reducing file complexity below the 250-line threshold through systematic modularization and component extraction.

## Problem

The modularize.md command file exceeds the simplicity principle threshold with 360 lines, violating the framework's core simplicity standards by 44% over the limit.

**Specific Issues**:
- Command file contains 360 lines (144% of 250-line limit)
- Extensive extraction strategies and analysis patterns embedded within command
- Complex dependency mapping and component identification dilute core functionality
- Multiple modularization approaches create cognitive overhead for users

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects modularization command usability, maintainability, and framework compliance
- **Users**: All developers using modularization for code organization and component extraction
- **Severity**: HIGH - Violates core framework principles and complicates modularization adoption

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. File complexity obscures essential modularization workflow execution
2. Violates simplicity.md principle requirement for focused, actionable commands
3. Creates maintenance burden for modularization methodology updates

## Solution

Implement systematic modularization by extracting complex extraction strategies and analysis patterns to specialized components while preserving core modularization workflow in simplified main command.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze current modularize.md structure and identify extractable components
   - Map essential modularization workflow vs. strategy documentation
   - Design component extraction strategy maintaining modularization integrity

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Extract extraction strategies to separate component files
   - Reduce main command to essential modularization execution
   - Create specialized components for dependency mapping approaches
   - Implement cross-references to extracted components

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify simplified command maintains full modularization capability
   - Test component references and ensure seamless integration
   - Validate compliance with 250-line simplicity threshold

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] modularize.md file reduced to under 250 lines while maintaining functionality
- [ ] Extraction strategies moved to appropriate component files
- [ ] Analysis patterns extracted to specialized components
- [ ] No regression in modularization capability or quality
- [ ] Full compliance with simplicity.md principle requirements

## Dependencies

- Reference to [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) for threshold requirements
- Reference to [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) for modular design patterns
- Component extraction following [modularization guidelines](../../docs/principles/organization.md)

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `commands/analysis/modularize.md` - Reduce to essential modularization workflow
- `docs/components/extraction-strategies.md` - Extract modularization strategies
- `docs/components/dependency-mapping-patterns.md` - Extract dependency analysis
- `docs/components/component-identification-framework.md` - Extract identification methods

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) by exceeding 250-line complexity threshold
- Impacts [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by mixing command and strategy documentation

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase extraction
- Supports [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by implementing modular design patterns
