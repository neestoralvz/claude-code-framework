## Purpose

‚è∫ **Principle**: This methodology implements [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) by providing systematic structure for ticket management and applies [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) through defined lifecycle phases.

Define standardized methodology for creating, managing, and tracking tickets throughout their lifecycle, ensuring consistent project execution and progress tracking.

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
‚è∫ **Principle**: Follows [fundamental.md](../principles/fundamental.md) by maintaining one authoritative location for all ticket information through centralized registry patterns.
- All tickets stored in `/docs/planning/tickets/`
- Registry dashboard provides unified view
- Status changes reflected immediately

### 2. Clear Lifecycle
‚è∫ **Principle**: Implements [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) through systematic phase progression and state management for lifecycle control.
- **Pending** ‚Üí **In Progress** ‚Üí **Completed**
- Alternative paths: **Blocked**, **Cancelled**
- Each transition documented with timestamps

### 3. Actionable Definition
‚è∫ **Principle**: Applies [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) by requiring clear, measurable, and implementable ticket definitions through imperative specifications.
- Every ticket must have clear acceptance criteria
- Measurable outcomes required
- Implementation steps defined

## Ticket Lifecycle

‚è∫ **Principle**: Implements [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) through systematic phase progression for structured execution.

Tickets progress through four phases: **Creation** ‚Üí **Activation** ‚Üí **Completion** ‚Üí **Archival**

## Ticket Structure

### Standard Template
```markdown
---
title: [Clear, Actionable Title]
ticket_id: [CATEGORY-###]
priority: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
status: [pending|in-progress|completed|blocked]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
category: [classification]
estimated_effort: [time estimate]
---

# Ticket: [Full Title]

## Problem
[Clear problem statement]

## Impact
- **Scope**: [What's affected]
- **Users**: [Who's impacted]
- **Severity**: [Critical|Major|Minor]

## Solution
[Proposed solution approach]

## Implementation Steps
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step n]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion n

## Dependencies
- [List dependencies or "None"]

## Notes
[Additional context]
```

## Priority and Classification

‚è∫ **Principle**: Follows [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) for systematic classification through hierarchical structure patterns.

Priority levels: **HIGH** (critical impact) | **MEDIUM** (important functionality) | **LOW** (nice-to-have)

Core categories: bug, feature, enhancement, refactor, documentation, performance, security, modularization

## Status Management

### Status Transitions
```
pending ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí in-progress ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚Üí completed
   ‚Üì                 ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
blocked ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò                archived
   ‚Üì
cancelled
```

### Status Commands
```bash
# Update ticket status
./scripts/manage-ticket-status.sh [TICKET-ID] [NEW-STATUS]

# Examples
./scripts/manage-ticket-status.sh MOD-001 in-progress
./scripts/manage-ticket-status.sh MOD-001 completed
./scripts/manage-ticket-status.sh MOD-002 blocked
```

## Workflow Integration

‚è∫ **Principle**: Integrates [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) by embedding ticket management into daily and weekly operational rhythms through systematic execution patterns.

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning Review**
   - Check registry dashboard
   - Review in-progress tickets
   - Identify blockers

2. **Work Session**
   - Select ticket from pending
   - Update status to in-progress
   - Implement solution
   - Update progress notes

3. **End of Session**
   - Update ticket status
   - Document progress
   - Update registry

### Weekly Review
- Analyze velocity metrics
- Review blocked tickets
- Prioritize upcoming work
- Archive completed tickets

## Automation Tools

### Registry Update
```bash
# Automatic registry synchronization
./scripts/update-ticket-registry.sh
```

### Bulk Operations
```bash
# Move all completed tickets older than 30 days
./scripts/archive-old-tickets.sh

# Generate status report
./scripts/generate-ticket-report.sh weekly
```

### Status Monitoring
```bash
# Check for stale in-progress tickets
./scripts/check-stale-tickets.sh

# Alert on blocked tickets
./scripts/monitor-blocked.sh
```

## Best Practices

‚è∫ **Principle**: These practices implement [engineering.md](../principles/engineering.md) through systematic quality control and [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) via clear documentation requirements.

### DO
- ‚úÖ Create tickets for all non-trivial work
- ‚úÖ Update status immediately when changing
- ‚úÖ Include clear acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Document blockers and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Link related tickets
- ‚úÖ Add implementation notes when completing

### DON'T
- ‚ùå Leave tickets in progress indefinitely
- ‚ùå Create duplicate tickets
- ‚ùå Skip status updates
- ‚ùå Ignore dependencies
- ‚ùå Complete without verification
- ‚ùå Delete tickets (archive instead)

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics
- **Velocity**: Tickets completed per week
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from start to completion
- **Blocked Rate**: Percentage of blocked tickets
- **Priority Distribution**: Breakdown by priority
- **Category Distribution**: Breakdown by type

### Reports
- Daily status summary
- Weekly velocity report
- Monthly trend analysis
- Quarterly retrospective

## Integration and Support

Integration with documentation, version control, and CI/CD systems ensures seamless workflow.
