## Framework Integration

⏺ **Principle**: Integration implements [CLAUDE.md ULTIMATE AUTHORITY](../CLAUDE.md#initialization-sequence) by activating recognition during Phase 1 initialization.

### Activation Point
**CLAUDE.md Phase 1: Load Core Documentation** - Intent recognition activates IMMEDIATELY after loading docs/index.md and docs/PRINCIPLES.md, enabling first-moment user request analysis.

### Authority Chain
1. **CLAUDE.md serves as ULTIMATE AUTHORITY** for initialization sequence
2. **Intent recognition activates during Phase 1** as documented enhancement
3. **Agent selection principles govern** command/agent deployment decisions
4. **Workflow methodology ensures** systematic execution of selected approach

### Framework Compliance
- **NO COMPETING AUTHORITY** - Recognition defers to CLAUDE.md initialization
- **AGENT-FIRST EXECUTION** - All recognized commands deploy through agent delegation
- **SYSTEMATIC PHASES** - Recognition triggers proper workflow methodology
- **PRINCIPLE ALIGNMENT** - All selections follow established principle load order

## Recognition Triggers

⏺ **Principle**: Recognition triggers implement [agent-selection.md mandatory agent usage](../principles/agent-selection.md) by analyzing user intent for immediate optimal routing.

### Immediate Analysis Points
1. **First user message received** - Instant intent analysis activation
2. **Task complexity assessment** - Determine specialization requirements
3. **Command pattern matching** - Map to existing command catalog
4. **Agent capability alignment** - Match with agent specializations

### Trigger Conditions
- **User request contains action verbs** (analyze, create, optimize, fix, implement)
- **Technical domain indicators** (code, system, documentation, testing)
- **Scope indicators** (project-wide, file-specific, component-level)
- **Quality requirements** (audit, validate, review, ensure)

[⬆ Return to top](#intent-recognition-and-command-mapping)

## Intent Analysis Matrix

⏺ **Principle**: Analysis matrix implements [workflow.md systematic phases](../principles/workflow.md) by categorizing user intents for optimal command/agent selection across atomic, orchestration, and concatenation command types.

### Command Type Classification

#### Atomic Commands
**Single-purpose, focused operations** - Direct agent delegation with specific command context
- Individual workflow phases (1-clarify, 2-explore, etc.)
- Specific analysis operations (system-audit, modularize)
- Management tasks (create-ticket, review-tickets)

#### Orchestration Commands
**Multi-agent coordination** - Deploy multiple agents with synchronized execution
- Each agent receives one command within prompt for focused execution
- Parallel execution with dependency management
- Coordinated result integration and validation

#### Concatenation Commands
**Sequential command chains** - Systematic progression through related operations
- Pipeline-style execution with output feeding next phase
- Pre-built compositions for common workflow patterns
- Conditional branching based on intermediate results

### Analysis Categories

#### Project-Level Intents
| Intent Pattern | Command Type | Optimal Command | Agent Orchestration | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "analyze entire project comprehensively" | Concatenation | [complete-analysis.md](../../commands/composition/complete-analysis.md) | Sequential: clarify→explore→audit→analyze→validate | End-to-end analysis workflow |
| "optimize/improve codebase iteratively" | Orchestration | [optimization-cycle.md](../../commands/composition/optimization-cycle.md) | Parallel: audit+modularize+analyze→validate | Iterative improvement coordination |

### Pattern Recognition Rules
- **Action verb identification** - Extract primary intent from user language
- **Scope complexity assessment** - Single task, multi-task, or workflow-level
- **Coordination requirement analysis** - Independent, parallel, or sequential execution
- **Domain classification** - Categorize technical area and specialization needs
- **Command type determination** - Atomic, orchestration, or concatenation pattern
- **Agent coupling specification** - Single, parallel, or sequential agent deployment
- **Output preference** - Identify desired result format and integration requirements

## Command Mapping Rules

⏺ **Principle**: Mapping rules implement [engineering.md modular design](../principles/engineering.md) by connecting user intents to optimal execution paths across atomic, orchestration, and concatenation command types.

### Selection Hierarchy
1. **Complexity assessment** - Single vs multi-step vs coordinated operations
2. **Command type determination** - Atomic, orchestration, or concatenation
3. **Agent coupling analysis** - Single agent, parallel agents, or sequential agents
4. **Execution pattern match** - Direct, coordinated, or pipelined execution

### Command Type Selection Framework

#### Atomic Command Selection
```
Single Intent → Direct Match → Single Agent → Single Command Context
     ↓               ↓              ↓                ↓
  "audit code"  → system-audit.md → security-analyst → "--scope comprehensive"
```

#### Orchestration Command Selection  
```
Multi-Stream Intent → Coordination Match → Multiple Agents → Parallel Execution
         ↓                    ↓                  ↓               ↓
  "develop features"  → parallel-development → frontend+backend → "sync-points integration"
                                              +testing agents
```

#### Concatenation Command Selection
```
Workflow Intent → Sequential Match → Agent Pipeline → Command Chain
      ↓                ↓               ↓              ↓
  "full analysis" → complete-analysis → clarify→explore → "--scope comprehensive"
                                       →audit→validate
```

### Agent-Command Coupling Specifications

#### Single Agent Coupling (Atomic)
- **One agent receives one command** within Task Tool prompt
- **Command parameters** specify execution scope and output format
- **Context handoff** includes all necessary information for autonomous execution
- **Result integration** direct incorporation into main workflow

#### Parallel Agent Coupling (Orchestration)
- **Multiple agents receive coordinated commands** with synchronization points
- **Dependency management** ensures proper execution order
- **Resource allocation** prevents conflicts between parallel streams
- **Result merger** combines outputs from multiple agents systematically

#### Sequential Agent Coupling (Concatenation)
- **Agent pipeline** where each agent's output feeds next agent's input
- **State preservation** maintains context across command chain
- **Conditional branching** allows dynamic path selection based on results
- **Error propagation** handles failures gracefully through the chain

### Fallback Strategy
- **No pattern match** → Deploy [delegation-advisor](../../agents/delegation-advisor.md) for routing analysis
- **Missing agent capability** → Generate ticket via [create-ticket.md](../../commands/management/create-ticket.md)
- **Ambiguous complexity** → Execute [1-clarify.md](../../commands/workflow/1-clarify.md) for requirements
- **Orchestration failure** → Fallback to sequential concatenation approach

## Agent Selection Integration

⏺ **Principle**: Integration implements [agent-selection.md mandatory usage](../principles/agent-selection.md) by ensuring ALL recognized commands deploy through agent delegation with proper command coupling.

### Integration Protocol by Command Type

#### Atomic Command Integration
1. **Intent recognition** identifies single optimal command/agent pair
2. **Agent availability validation** confirms agent exists in /agents/ folder
3. **Command context preparation** packages command with parameters for agent prompt
4. **Single agent deployment** via Task Tool with complete command specification
5. **Direct result integration** incorporates agent output into main workflow

#### Orchestration Command Integration
1. **Multi-agent requirement analysis** identifies all needed agent specializations
2. **Coordination pattern selection** determines synchronization and dependency strategy
3. **Parallel deployment preparation** sets up coordinated agent execution
4. **Multiple agent deployment** via parallel Task Tool invocations with sync points
5. **Result merger coordination** combines multiple agent outputs systematically

#### Concatenation Command Integration
1. **Pipeline analysis** identifies sequential command chain requirements
2. **Agent sequence planning** determines optimal agent progression
3. **State handoff preparation** ensures context preservation between agents
4. **Sequential agent deployment** via chained Task Tool invocations
5. **Pipeline result integration** processes final output from command chain

### Quality Assurance
- **ZERO DIRECT EXECUTION** - All commands execute through agents regardless of type
- **COMMAND-AGENT COUPLING** - Each agent receives exactly one command in prompt
- **ORCHESTRATION INTEGRITY** - Parallel execution maintains synchronization
- **CONCATENATION CONTINUITY** - Sequential execution preserves state across chain
- **FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE** - All selections follow established principles
- **CONTEXT PRESERVATION** - Main instance maintains coordination role across all patterns
