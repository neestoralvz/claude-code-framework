# COMMUNICATION

## Core Philosophy

⏺ **Principle**: Communication serves clarity, directness, and actionable understanding across all system interactions.

**Why**: Clear communication reduces cognitive load, eliminates ambiguity, and enables immediate, confident action.

**What**: An imperative, minimal approach to expression that prioritizes understanding and action over verbosity and decoration.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Imperative Philosophy
- Direct readers toward specific actions
- State commands rather than descriptions
- Enable immediate understanding and execution

### Clarity Philosophy
- Eliminate ambiguity and confusion
- Minimize cognitive load through directness
- Support universal understanding across contexts

### Efficiency Philosophy
- Maintain minimal expression for maximum understanding
- Remove unnecessary verbosity and embellishment
- Focus on essential information transfer

## Implementation Framework

**[Apply communication-templates.md for detailed implementation](../templates/templates/components/communication-templates.md)**

All specific communication patterns, tone guidelines, and expression templates are provided through the communication templates component.

## Principle References

⏺ **Relationship**: This communication principle ensures clear expression across all documentation:
- **[fundamental.md](fundamental.md)**: Provides simplicity approach for minimal communication
- **[directive.md](directive.md)**: Supplies imperative command framework
