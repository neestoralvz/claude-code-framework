# GIT WORKFLOW

‚è∫ **Principle**: Git workflow integration provides systematic version control methodology aligned with the 8-phase workflow, ensuring code integrity, collaboration standards, and deployment reliability.

## Core Philosophy

‚è∫ **Principle**: Git operations must align systematically with workflow phases to maintain code integrity, enable collaboration, and support continuous integration.

**Why**: Consistent Git practices ensure version control reliability, enable efficient collaboration, maintain code quality, and support systematic deployment processes.

**What**: Integration of Git operations within the 8-phase methodology, standardized commit practices, branch management protocols, and quality gate enforcement.

## Workflow Phase Integration

### Clarification Phase - Repository Setup
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Initialize or verify repository state
git status
git branch -v
git remote -v
```

**Standards**:
- Verify current branch alignment with task scope
- Confirm clean working directory before starting
- Validate remote repository connectivity

### Exploration Phase - Context Gathering
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Examine repository history and context
git log --oneline -10
git diff HEAD~1
git show --stat
```

**Standards**:
- Review recent commits for context
- Identify potential conflicts or dependencies
- Map repository structure to task requirements

### Analysis Phase - Change Planning
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Analyze current state and plan changes
git diff --cached
git diff HEAD
git log --graph --oneline
```

**Standards**:
- Assess impact of planned changes
- Identify merge conflict potential
- Plan branch strategy for implementation

### Solution Presentation Phase - Strategy Confirmation
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Present branching and merge strategy
git branch --list
git log --graph --all --oneline
```

**Standards**:
- Confirm branch creation strategy
- Validate merge approach
- Align on collaboration workflow

### Planning Phase - Branch Creation
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Create feature branch with descriptive naming
git checkout -b feature/task-description
git push -u origin feature/task-description
```

**Standards**:
- Use descriptive branch naming convention
- Set upstream tracking immediately
- Document branch purpose in commit message

### Implementation Phase - Systematic Commits
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Stage and commit changes systematically
git add [specific-files]
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
git push origin feature/task-description
```

**Standards**:
- Stage changes logically and atomically
- Use conventional commit message format
- Push regularly to maintain backup

### Ripple Effect Phase - Integration Management
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Handle integration and dependencies
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/task-description
```

**Standards**:
- Rebase feature branch on latest main
- Resolve conflicts systematically
- Maintain clean commit history

### Validation Phase - Quality Verification
**Git Operations**:
```bash
# Create pull request and validate
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
git diff main..HEAD
git log main..HEAD --oneline
```

**Standards**:
- Create descriptive pull request
- Verify all changes are intentional
- Confirm CI/CD pipeline success

## Git Operation Standards

### Atomic Commits
‚è∫ **Principle**: Each commit represents a single, complete change that can be safely reverted.

**Implementation**:
- One logical change per commit
- Ensure each commit builds successfully
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Stage files selectively using `git add [file]`

### Commit Message Format
**Standard Format**:
```
type(scope): description

- Detailed explanation if needed
- Breaking changes noted
- Related issue references

```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
**Scope**: Component or area affected
**Description**: Imperative mood, present tense, lowercase

### Branch Naming Convention
**Format**: `type/description-with-hyphens`

**Types**:
- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code restructuring
- `test/` - Test additions/modifications

## Branch Management

### Main Branch Protection
‚è∫ **Principle**: Main branch maintains production-ready code through systematic protection and review processes.

**Standards**:
- Require pull request reviews
- Enforce status checks before merge
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict direct pushes to main

### Feature Branch Workflow
**Process**:
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Implement changes with atomic commits
3. Rebase on latest main regularly
4. Create pull request when complete
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge with squash or merge commit

### Branch Cleanup
**Operations**:
```bash
# After merge completion
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/completed-task
git push origin --delete feature/completed-task
```

## Collaboration Protocols

### Pull Request Standards
‚è∫ **Principle**: Pull requests enable systematic code review, knowledge sharing, and quality assurance.

**Requirements**:
- Descriptive title and summary
- Clear change description
- Test evidence inclusion
- Documentation updates
- Breaking change notifications

**Review Process**:
- Minimum one reviewer approval
- Address all review comments
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline success
- Confirm deployment readiness

### Conflict Resolution
**Process**:
1. Fetch latest changes: `git fetch origin`
2. Rebase feature branch: `git rebase origin/main`
3. Resolve conflicts systematically
4. Test resolution thoroughly
5. Force push with lease: `git push --force-with-lease`

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit Validation
**Automated Checks**:
- Code formatting (prettier, black, etc.)
- Linting (eslint, ruff, etc.)
- Type checking (typescript, mypy, etc.)
- Basic tests execution

### Pre-Push Validation
**Extended Checks**:
- Full test suite execution
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Documentation generation
- Performance regression tests

### Pre-Merge Validation
**Comprehensive Checks**:
- Integration test execution
- Cross-browser/platform testing
- Security audit completion
- Performance benchmark validation

## Integration with Engineering Standards

‚è∫ **Principle**: Git workflow must align with [engineering.md technical standards](engineering.md) for comprehensive quality assurance.

**Connections**:
- **Code Quality**: Enforce through pre-commit hooks
- **Testing**: Validate through CI/CD pipeline
- **Documentation**: Update through automated processes
- **Security**: Scan through automated tools
