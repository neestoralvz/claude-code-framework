# CONTEXT EFFICIENCY

⏺ **Principle**: The main Claude Code instance preserves context through strategic Task Tool delegation while maintaining workflow orchestration control.

## Core Methodology

⏺ **Principle**: This methodology implements [workflow.md systematic phases](workflow.md) by maintaining main instance context while delegating specialized execution to expert agents.

### Primary Objectives
- **Preserve main instance context** for continuous user communication quality
- **Delegate task execution** to specialized agents via Task Tool
- **Maintain workflow orchestration** from main instance
- **Optimize response quality** through context preservation

### Context Preservation Strategy
- **Never delegate communication** - Main instance handles all user interaction
- **Always delegate execution** - Specialized agents handle implementation
- **Preserve decision-making context** - Main instance retains strategic control
- **Maintain quality oversight** - Main instance validates all agent outputs

## Agent Delegation Framework

⏺ **Principle**: This framework implements [engineering.md modular design](engineering.md) through systematic agent deployment for every task execution.

### Delegation Rules
- **Execute through Task Tool** for all non-trivial operations
- **Analyze agent requirements** before deployment
- **Select optimal agent** from catalog or create new one
- **Validate agent outputs** before presenting to user

### Task Classification
- **Immediate tasks**: Direct tool usage (Read, Write, Bash)
- **Complex tasks**: Agent delegation required
- **Multi-step tasks**: Always delegate to specialized agents
- **Analysis tasks**: Deploy analytical agents (project-optimizer, etc.)

## Context Preservation Rules

⏺ **Principle**: These rules implement [directive.md execution requirements](directive.md) for maintaining main instance effectiveness.

### What Main Instance Retains
- **User communication context** - Complete conversation history
- **Strategic decision-making** - Overall approach and methodology
- **Quality validation** - Final output verification
- **Workflow orchestration** - Phase management and progression

### What Gets Delegated
- **Code implementation** - Specialized development agents
- **File analysis** - Expert analysis agents
- **System operations** - Technical execution agents
- **Documentation creation** - Content generation agents
- **Information processing** - Synthesis and consolidation specialists

### Context Handoff Protocol
1. **Prepare delegation context** - Extract relevant information for agent
2. **Define success criteria** - Establish validation requirements
3. **Deploy specialized agent** - Execute via Task Tool
4. **Deploy information processing** - Synthesize findings when multiple sources involved
5. **Validate agent output** - Verify quality and completeness
6. **Integrate results** - Present to user with main instance context

### Information Processing Workflow

⏺ **Principle**: **All specialized agents conducting exploration, analysis, or research MUST process and synthesize their findings through dedicated information processing specialists before delivering context to the orchestrator, ensuring fully processed, actionable intelligence delivery.**

#### Processing Requirements
- **Task-based synthesis** - Process information per task rather than per gathering activity
- **Multiple source consolidation** - Integrate findings from exploration, analysis, and research agents
- **Orchestrator-ready delivery** - Provide fully processed intelligence requiring no additional analysis
- **Cognitive efficiency** - Minimize orchestrator processing overhead through pre-synthesis

#### Processing Workflow
1. **Information gathering phase** - Multiple agents collect data according to task requirements
2. **Processing specialist deployment** - Deploy synthesis agent for comprehensive consolidation
3. **Intelligence preparation** - Transform raw findings into actionable insights and recommendations
4. **Processed delivery** - Provide orchestrator with ready-to-use, fully analyzed intelligence

## Quality Control

⏺ **Principle**: Quality control implements [workflow.md validation phase](workflow.md#7-validation) through systematic agent output verification.

### Validation Requirements
- **Verify agent deliverables** against success criteria
- **Ensure framework compliance** with all principles
- **Validate technical quality** per engineering standards
- **Confirm user requirement fulfillment** completely

### Main Instance Responsibilities
- **Never present unvalidated agent outputs** directly to user
- **Always verify compliance** with framework principles
- **Maintain quality standards** across all delegated work
- **Provide coherent integration** of agent results
