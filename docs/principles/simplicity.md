# SIMPLICITY

## Core Principle
**Essential Question**: What is the minimum information needed?

## Standards
1. **Brevity**: Use fewest words necessary
2. **Clarity**: Direct, actionable language
3. **Purpose**: Every element serves essential function
4. **Focus**: Single topic per section

## Guidelines
- Answer the user's exact question
- Remove unnecessary explanation
- Use simple sentence structure
- Eliminate redundant information

## Validation Tests
**Before Publishing**:
- Can anything be removed without losing meaning?
- Does each sentence add essential value?
- Does less text improve user understanding?

**Quality Gates**:
- Remove examples that don't clarify
- Eliminate redundant phrases
- Choose shorter words when equal
- Delete obvious statements
