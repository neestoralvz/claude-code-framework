# Playbook Narrative Formatting Principle

## Authority

This principle governs all playbook documentation to maintain consistent imperative command narrative that drives immediate action.

## Core Directive

Structure every playbook section as direct actionable commands that tell the user exactly what to do next, maintaining flow without technical documentation interruptions.

## Formatting Requirements

### Command Structure
Write every instruction as an imperative verb statement. Begin with action words that command immediate execution. Transform passive descriptions into active commands that drive user behavior.

### Navigation Flow
Design each section to guide users through sequential decision points. Present choices as question-based routing that leads to specific actions. Create clear pathways from current state to desired outcome.

### Content Organization
Organize information as execution sequences rather than reference material. Structure content to answer "what do I do now" instead of "what does this mean". Present information in the order users need to act on it.

### Language Patterns
Use direct address with second person commands. Write in present tense with active voice construction. Eliminate explanatory preambles that delay action execution.

### Section Headers
Create headers that indicate user actions rather than topic descriptions. Use action-oriented language that tells users what they will accomplish. Focus on outcomes rather than concepts.

### Link Integration
Embed navigation as continuation of command flow. Present links as next steps in the execution sequence. Integrate references as part of the instruction narrative.

## Implementation Standards

### Decision Points
Structure choices as conditional routing commands. Present options as "if this situation then execute that action" format. Create clear branching logic that maintains command flow.

### Procedure Documentation
Document each step as executable instruction. Break complex processes into atomic commands that require single actions. Sequence instructions to build toward complete task execution.

### Quality Validation
Verify that every section drives user toward specific action. Ensure no paragraph exists purely for informational purposes. Confirm that reading any section results in clear next steps.

## Enforcement Criteria

Every playbook section must pass the action test: does this content tell the user exactly what to do next? If any content serves only informational purposes, restructure it as actionable guidance that drives execution.

Maintain narrative momentum by eliminating reference material that interrupts command flow. Keep users moving through decision points toward task completion without stopping for background reading.

## Success Indicators

Users complete playbook sequences without confusion about next steps. Documentation flows as unified command narrative rather than collection of separate information blocks. Every interaction results in clear action execution toward defined outcomes.
