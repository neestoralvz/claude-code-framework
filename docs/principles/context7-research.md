## Research Requirements

⏺ **Principle**: This principle implements [fundamental.md#evidence](fundamental.md#evidence) by requiring comprehensive research before code implementation and supports [engineering.md#methodologies](engineering.md#methodologies) through systematic preparation.

### Mandatory Research Phase
Before writing any code, you MUST conduct comprehensive research using context7:

- **Pattern Analysis**: Study existing patterns and architectural approaches
- **Information Gathering**: Collect relevant documentation and examples
- **Installation Guides**: Review setup and configuration requirements
- **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Understand common issues and solutions
- **Best Practices**: Identify recommended approaches and methodologies

### Research Validation
- Document findings in structured format
- Validate patterns against project requirements
- Confirm compatibility with existing architecture
- Identify potential conflicts or issues

## Research Process

⏺ **Principle**: Research process follows [workflow.md#1-clarification](workflow.md#1-clarification) and [workflow.md#2-research](workflow.md#2-research) phases for systematic investigation.

### Phase 1: Context7 Library Resolution
1. **Identify Required Libraries**: Determine what libraries or frameworks are needed
2. **Resolve Library IDs**: Use context7 to obtain proper library identifiers
3. **Validate Scope**: Confirm research scope covers all dependencies

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Documentation Review
1. **Fetch Documentation**: Retrieve up-to-date documentation using context7
2. **Study Patterns**: Analyze architectural patterns and design approaches
3. **Review Examples**: Examine code examples and implementation patterns
4. **Understand Constraints**: Identify limitations and requirements

### Phase 3: Integration Planning
1. **Assess Compatibility**: Evaluate integration with existing codebase
2. **Identify Dependencies**: Map all required dependencies and versions
3. **Plan Implementation**: Design implementation approach based on research
4. **Prepare Troubleshooting**: Anticipate issues and prepare solutions

### Knowledge Persistence
- Store research findings in accessible format
- Create reusable documentation templates
- Maintain research history for future reference
- Update findings based on implementation experience

## Implementation Integration

⏺ **Principle**: Implementation integration ensures [workflow.md#5-implementation](workflow.md#5-implementation) follows research-informed decisions and maintains [engineering.md#standards](engineering.md#standards).

### Research-to-Code Workflow
1. **Complete Research Phase**: Finish all context7 investigation before coding
2. **Validate Approach**: Confirm chosen patterns align with research findings
3. **Follow Documentation**: Implement according to researched best practices
4. **Apply Troubleshooting**: Use researched solutions for anticipated issues

### Quality Gates
- **Pre-Implementation**: Verify research completeness
- **During Implementation**: Follow researched patterns consistently
- **Post-Implementation**: Validate against researched expectations
- **Documentation Update**: Record implementation experience for future reference

### Continuous Learning
- Update research based on implementation results
- Share findings with team for knowledge transfer
- Refine research process based on effectiveness
- Maintain current documentation for future projects
