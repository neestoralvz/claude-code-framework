# FORMATTING

## Core Philosophy

⏺ **Principle**: Formatting serves consistency, clarity, and cognitive efficiency across all system communications.

**Why**: Consistent formatting reduces cognitive load, enables predictable navigation, and ensures universal understanding across diverse contexts.

**What**: A unified approach to document structure, presentation patterns, and visual hierarchy that supports the system's communication goals.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Consistency Philosophy
- Establish predictable patterns for all document types
- Maintain visual consistency across system boundaries
- Support cognitive efficiency through familiar structures

### Clarity Philosophy  
- Prioritize understanding over decoration
- Eliminate ambiguity in presentation patterns
- Ensure accessibility across user contexts

### Efficiency Philosophy
- Minimize cognitive load through standard patterns
- Enable rapid navigation and comprehension
- Support systematic content discovery

## Implementation Framework

**[Apply formatting-standards.md for detailed implementation](../templates/templates/components/formatting-standards.md)**

All specific formatting rules, templates, and implementation details are provided through the formatting standards component.

## Principle References

⏺ **Relationship**: This formatting principle provides visual consistency for all other principles:
- **[communication.md](communication.md)**: Supports clear expression through consistent presentation
- **[organization.md](organization.md)**: Enables logical structure through formatting patterns
- **[fundamental.md](fundamental.md)**: Maintains simplicity through minimal, predictable formats
