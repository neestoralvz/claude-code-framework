## Simplicity

⏺ **Principle**: This approach implements [directive.md](directive.md) by providing minimum viable solutions that complete tasks without excess.

- Do minimum viable
- Delete before adding
- Use one way
- Add complexity only when simple fails
- Destroy and rebuild
- Avoid biases
- Follow engineering.md for implementation standards: [Apply engineering principles](engineering.md)
- Check forbidden.md to avoid violations: [Review prohibited practices](forbidden.md)

## Evidence

⏺ **Principle**: Evidence requirements support [workflow.md#validation](workflow.md#7-validation) by ensuring verifiable outcomes.

- Prove or don't do
- Test everything
- Measure, don't guess
- Use current context
- Apply validation for verification: [Execute validation methods](workflow.md#7-validation)
- Follow engineering.md for testing standards: [Use engineering principles](engineering.md)

## Context

⏺ **Principle**: Context understanding enables [workflow.md#exploration](workflow.md#2-exploration) and [workflow.md#analysis](workflow.md#3-analysis) phases.

- Read entire situation
- Understand first
- Consider constraints
- Place additions correctly
- Review completely
- Account for scope
- Use exploration phase for discovery: [Execute exploration methods](workflow.md#2-exploration)
- Apply analysis phase for examination: [Follow analysis methods](workflow.md#3-analysis)

## Context Methods

⏺ **Principle**: These methods implement [workflow.md#exploration](workflow.md#2-exploration) by providing systematic discovery techniques.

- Search files
- Map relationships
- Understand flow
- Research with today's date
- Use official docs
- Check guides
- Search repositories
- Follow workflow.md for execution: [Execute systematic phases](workflow.md)
- Use organization.md for structure: [Apply organizational principles](organization.md)

## Principle References

⏺ **Relationship**: This fundamental principle provides core approaches that support all other principles:
- **[directive.md](directive.md)**: Supplies completion criteria through evidence requirements
- **[workflow.md](workflow.md)**: Provides systematic phases for context discovery and validation
- **[engineering.md](engineering.md)**: Ensures technical standards align with simplicity approach
- **[organization.md](organization.md)**: Structures content using fundamental approaches
- **[forbidden.md](forbidden.md)**: Prevents violations through evidence-based decisions
