## The Core Command
**Do only what the user asks for - nothing more, nothing less**

## How to Execute Properly

These rules establish clear execution boundaries and completion criteria by implementing systematic workflow principles.

- Stop when you finish what was asked
- Check if you fulfilled the request before stopping
- Always apply the working principles
- Don't do extra things that weren't requested
- Follow the workflow guide for systematic execution
- Check the validation guide for completion criteria
- Read the forbidden practices guide to avoid violations
- Apply the communication guide for proper tone

## Implementation Framework

### Standard Startup Sequence

All initialization follows the main CLAUDE.md guide exclusively.

**Follow the CLAUDE.md startup sequence for all system initialization.** This includes the complete 3-step initialization process and principle loading order sequence.

### How to Implement Authority Patterns

#### Before Running Commands
Check these things before executing:
- Load core documentation following this directive
- Apply relevant principles following CLAUDE.md loading order
- Select appropriate tools from the commands guide
- Plan execution approach using workflow planning phase
- Prepare verification method using fundamental evidence requirements

#### How Specialists Start Up
1. **Load System Context**
   - Read this directive for operational framework
   - Apply workflow principles for execution methodology
   - Study relevant principles for your domain

2. **Set Up Environment**
   - Check tool access and permissions
   - Load required dependencies
   - Initialize working context

3. **Validate Readiness**
   - Confirm initialization is complete
   - Test critical functionality
   - Prepare for task execution

#### How the Whole System Starts
1. **Load the Foundation**
   - Load this directive as primary authority
   - Establish workflow principles as execution framework
   - Apply fundamental principles as philosophical base

2. **Activate Components**
   - Initialize validation principles for quality assurance
   - Load organization principles for structural standards
   - Activate engineering principles for technical quality

3. **Verify Everything Works**
   - Check that all components loaded correctly
   - Test communication between components
   - Confirm system integrity

## Advanced Authority Patterns

These advanced patterns implement directive authority requirements through standardized templates for command, agent, and system initialization with comprehensive compliance verification.

### Enhanced Initialization Templates

#### Initialization Checklist Template
Use this pattern for initialization:

**INITIALIZATION CHECKLIST**
All initialization follows CLAUDE.md ultimate authority

**Complete CLAUDE.md Step 3 validation checklist requirements before proceeding.**

#### Component Integration Pattern
Use this pattern for component integration:

Component follows this directive's core command patterns

**Integration Requirements**
1. Reference governing principle with reference marker
2. Implement loading order where applicable
3. Provide verification checkpoints
4. Maintain system consistency

### How Authority Hierarchy Works

#### Who Has What Authority
- **CLAUDE.md**: Ultimate authority for all operational directives
- **This directive**: Primary execution framework
- **Principle modules**: Domain-specific authority within their scope
- **Component files**: Implementation authority only

#### How to Handle Authority Conflicts
**Exception Handling Framework**
1. **Authority Conflicts**: CLAUDE.md ultimate authority always wins
2. **Load Order Disputes**: CLAUDE.md sequence takes precedence
3. **Implementation Conflicts**: Most recent principle update applies
4. **System Integrity**: This directive's validation requirements are mandatory

## Which Document Has Authority

**All principle loading order sequences come exclusively from CLAUDE.md Step 2 as the single authoritative source.**

**CLAUDE.md has ultimate authority** and contains the definitive principle application sequence that overrides all other loading order references. This document provides no competing sequence and defers completely to CLAUDE.md authority.

### Initialization Requirements

**Follow the CLAUDE.md initialization sequence exclusively for all system initialization.** This includes the complete 3-step initialization process and principle loading order sequence.

### Benefits of Single Authority
- **Single Authority**: CLAUDE.md provides unified principle application sequence
- **Consistency**: All components reference centralized loading order
- **Reliability**: Prevents conflicts through single source of truth
- **Traceability**: Clear authority chain from CLAUDE.md

## How to Validate and Stay Compliant

These validation methods implement directive verification requirements through systematic health checks, compliance monitoring, and integrity validation for comprehensive system assurance.

### How to Verify Loading Order

#### Verification Checklist
Check these things:
- All required documentation loaded
- Principles applied in correct order
- Components initialized properly
- System integrity maintained
- Verification methods prepared

#### How to Verify Implementation
Verify component integration by:
1. Check all reference markers point to valid principles
2. Confirm loading order implementation consistency
3. Test initialization sequence completeness
4. Validate cross-component references

### System Health Checks

#### Documentation Consistency
- **Principle Markers**: All reference markers point to valid principles
- **Link Integrity**: All navigation follows directive standards
- **Load Order**: All initialization sequences defer to CLAUDE.md authority
- **Template Usage**: Components use standardized patterns

#### Component Alignment
- **Authority Recognition**: All components implement directive principles
- **Cross-References**: Valid links between related components
- **Integration Points**: Proper dependency declarations
- **Verification Gates**: Built-in validation checkpoints

#### Operational Readiness
- **System Initialization**: Complete startup sequence execution
- **Tool Accessibility**: Required tools available and functional
- **Parameter Validation**: All required parameters present
- **Execution Preparedness**: Ready for task execution

### Validation Patterns

#### Before Starting Work
Check system readiness:
- Directive principles loaded and applied
- Workflow phases initialized
- Required tools accessible
- Parameters validated
- Verification methods prepared

#### After Finishing Work
Verify completion:
- Task objectives achieved
- Quality standards maintained
- Documentation updated
- System integrity preserved
- No forbidden patterns introduced

### Why Validation Helps
- **Reliability**: Systematic validation prevents errors
- **Compliance**: Ensures directive principle adherence
- **Quality**: Maintains system integrity through verification
- **Traceability**: Clear audit trail for validation steps

## Managing System Integration
