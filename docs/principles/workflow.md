# WORKFLOW

⏺ **Principle**: This document implements systematic workflow methodology as defined by CLAUDE.md ultimate authority. All workflow implementations follow this methodology while maintaining deference to CLAUDE.md for operational directives.

## Core Philosophy

⏺ **Principle**: Workflow provides systematic, repeatable methodology for complete task execution from conception to validated completion.

**Why**: Systematic workflow ensures consistent quality, comprehensive task completion, and predictable outcomes across diverse task types and complexity levels.

**What**: An eight-phase methodology that guides task execution from initial clarification through validated completion, with recursive improvement capabilities.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Systematic Philosophy

- Execute tasks through defined, repeatable phases
- Maintain consistent methodology across all task types
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of task requirements

### Completeness Philosophy

- Address all aspects of task execution systematically
- Validate outcomes against established success criteria
- Achieve demonstrable, measurable completion

### Recursive Philosophy

- Enable continuous improvement through validation feedback
- Support iterative refinement toward optimal outcomes
- Maintain quality standards through systematic review

## Nine-Phase Methodology

The workflow consists of nine MANDATORY core phases executed systematically with modern research capabilities:

1. **Clarification (MANDATORY)** - Establish complete request understanding and success criteria - NO EXCEPTIONS
2. **Exploration (MANDATORY)** - Gather comprehensive contextual information - CANNOT BE SKIPPED  
3. **Research (MANDATORY)** - Execute modern online research with current information and Context7 - OBLIGATORY EXECUTION
4. **Analysis (MANDATORY)** - Transform findings into actionable solution frameworks with current context - REQUIRED COMPLETION
5. **Solution Presentation (MANDATORY)** - Enable informed decision-making through structured dialogue - OBLIGATORY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
6. **Planning (MANDATORY)** - Design atomic, hierarchical implementation approach with mandatory principle validation - CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT VALIDATION
7. **Implementation (MANDATORY)** - Execute planned solution through specialized agents - OBLIGATORY EXECUTION OF VALIDATED PLAN
8. **Ripple Effect (MANDATORY)** - Manage implementation consequences and dependencies - OBLIGATORY IMPACT MANAGEMENT
9. **Validation (MANDATORY)** - Verify completion against established success criteria and current standards - FINAL OBLIGATORY VERIFICATION

**⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULE: ALL 9 PHASES ARE MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS**
- Each phase builds systematically on previous phases, with MANDATORY recursive capability until complete validation success
- Sequential execution required in exact order 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9
- No phase can be skipped or bypassed under any circumstances
- Completion criteria must be satisfied before proceeding to next phase
- **MANDATORY RECURSION**: If validation fails, MUST recurse through workflow until TOTAL VALIDATION ACHIEVED
- **OBJECTIVE VALIDATION REQUIRED**: All validation must use mathematical calculations and evidence-based scripts
- **NO PARTIAL SUCCESS**: Only complete mathematical validation success terminates workflow execution

## Implementation Framework

### Standard Phase Definitions

The following standard phase definitions provide consistent execution methodology across all commands and operations:

#### 1. Clarification (MANDATORY)

## Operational Guidance

⏺ **Principle**: Systematic workflow execution requires clear operational guidance for every situation and decision point.

### Quick Decision Navigation

**Starting a task**:

```
What do I need to do?
├─ 🤔 Understand requirements → 1-clarify
├─ 🔍 Gather information → 2-explore  
├─ 🧠 Analyze findings → 3-analyze
├─ 🎯 Choose solution → 4-present-solutions
├─ 📋 Plan implementation → 5-plan
├─ ⚡ Execute tasks → 6-implement
├─ 🔄 Handle consequences → 7-ripple-effect
├─ ✅ Verify completion → 8-validate
├─ 🐛 Fix problems → 9-debug
└─ 🔁 Improve quality → 10-recurse
```

**When problems occur**:

```
Problem detected → 9-debug --focus [problem-type]
├─ Workflow blockage → Fix → Resume from stable phase
├─ Quality issues → Analyze → 10-recurse from root cause
├─ Agent failures → Redeploy → Monitor coordination
├─ Requirements change → 10-recurse --strategy adaptive
└─ System failure → Emergency recovery procedures
```
