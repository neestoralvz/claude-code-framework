## Architecture Overview

The Claude Code framework implements **command-centered architecture** with **SOLID-compliant design patterns** enabling **systematic task execution** through **embedded principles**, **automatic agent deployment**, and **integrated validation frameworks**.

### Start Here
**[Access system-architecture-overview.md for complete framework understanding](system-architecture-overview.md)** - Comprehensive system architecture, cross-component integration analysis, SOLID compliance assessment, and overall design patterns

## Core Architecture Documents

### System-Wide Architecture
- **[system-architecture-overview.md](system-architecture-overview.md)** - Complete framework architecture with SOLID compliance and integration analysis
- **[command-consolidation-architecture.md](command-consolidation-architecture.md)** - Command-centered consolidation methodology and execution patterns
- **[agent-orchestration-framework.md](agent-orchestration-framework.md)** - Agent coordination patterns and deployment strategies

### Design and Decision Frameworks
- **[command-enhancement-patterns.md](command-enhancement-patterns.md)** - Command improvement and optimization patterns
- **[decision-matrix-specifications.md](decision-matrix-specifications.md)** - Decision framework and selection criteria

## Specialized Architecture Patterns

### Command Architecture Patterns
```
Command-Centered Design:
├── BaseCommand (Abstract Foundation)
├── ValidationFramework (Pluggable Validation)
├── AgentCoordinator (Deployment Abstraction)
└── WorkflowEngine (Systematic Execution)
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns
```
Agent Orchestration:
├── CapabilityBasedStrategy (Requirement Matching)
├── LoadBalancedStrategy (Workload Distribution)
├── ExpertiseBasedStrategy (Domain Expertise)
└── ResourceOptimizedStrategy (Resource Utilization)
```

### Quality Integration Patterns
```
Four-Gate Validation:
├── Requirements Gate (Specification Verification)
├── Process Gate (Methodology Compliance)
├── Output Gate (Deliverable Quality)
└── System Gate (Integration Stability)
```

## Integration with Framework Components

### Core Framework Integration
- **[Core Framework Components](../components/core-framework/)** - Modular components implementing architecture patterns
- **[Principles Foundation](../principles/)** - Philosophical guidance governing architectural decisions
- **[Command Implementation](../../commands/)** - SOLID-compliant command execution with architecture patterns

### Architecture Benefits
- **SOLID Compliance** - Full adherence to SOLID principles with verification
- **Modular Design** - Components with single responsibilities and clear interfaces
- **Quality Integration** - Embedded validation and automatic compliance
- **Extensible Patterns** - Plugin architecture and open/closed principle adherence

## Cross-References

### Framework Access
- **[Framework Orchestration Hub](../../CLAUDE.md)** - Central framework access with architecture integration
- **[Documentation Hub](../index.md)** - Primary navigation with architecture guidance
- **[Commands Index](../../commands/index.md)** - Command execution with architectural patterns

### Core Components
- **[Core Framework Components](../components/core-framework/)** - Implementation of architecture patterns
- **[SOLID Architecture Implementation](../../commands/SOLID_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete SOLID-compliant framework design
- **[Principles Foundation](../principles/)** - Philosophical foundation for architectural decisions

### System Integration
- **[Systems Integration](../SYSTEMS_INTEGRATION.md)** - External system integration patterns
- **[Enforcement System](../enforcement-system-overview.md)** - System enforcement and monitoring architecture
