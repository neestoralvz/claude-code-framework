# Index Coherence Check

**Context**: Validation check for framework index accuracy and file count consistency

## Index Coherence Validation Criteria

Verify index files accurately reflect actual system contents and counts.

### Count Accuracy Checks
- Do index file counts match actual directory contents?
- Are all existing files referenced in relevant indices?
- Do summary counts align with actual component numbers?
- Are there unreferenced or missing files?

### Reference Checks
- Do index entries point to existing files?
- Are file descriptions accurate and current?
- Do index links work correctly?
- Are there outdated or incorrect references?

### Completeness Checks
- Are all framework components represented in indices?
- Do indices cover all relevant directories?
- Are new files added to appropriate indices?
- Are there index gaps or omissions?

### Structure Checks
- Do indices follow consistent formatting?
- Are index categories logically organized?
- Do index structures align with directory organization?
- Are there conflicting index approaches?

### Maintenance Checks
- Are indices kept current with system changes?
- Do automated counts match manual verification?
- Are index updates part of workflow processes?
- Is index maintenance responsibility clear?
