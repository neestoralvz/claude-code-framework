# Naming Correction Workflow

**Context**: Systematic process for correcting file and directory names to framework standards

## Required Reading
Read these files before executing this workflow:
- **[Simple Naming Standard](../standards/simple-naming.md)** - Core naming rules and requirements
- **[File Renamer Tool](../tools/file-renamer.md)** - Utility process for renaming operations
- **[Naming Check](../checks/naming-check.md)** - Validation criteria for name compliance
- **[Good Naming Examples](../examples/good-naming.md)** - Practical examples of correct naming patterns

Systematic process for correcting non-standard names across the framework.

## Identification Phase
Scan and identify files/directories that don't meet naming standards using automated checks and manual review.

## Analysis Phase
Evaluate current names against standards: lowercase with hyphens, descriptive, concise, action-based when applicable.

## Planning Phase
Create systematic rename plan with dependency mapping and reference tracking to avoid broken links.

## Execution Phase
Execute renames in dependency order, update all cross-references, and maintain navigation integrity.

## Validation Phase
Verify all references work, navigation functions correctly, and names meet framework standards using naming-check validation.
