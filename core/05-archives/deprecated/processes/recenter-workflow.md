# Recenter Workflow

_Last updated: 2025-08-20 | Version: 2.0_

## Purpose

The Recenter Workflow ensures perpetual alertness to execution patterns, automatic optimization detection, and systematic approach to every task. This workflow transforms the simple "recenter" reminder into a comprehensive execution framework.

## The RECENTER Command

**`RECENTER`** → Activates comprehensive execution analysis and optimization:

1. **Task Analysis & TodoWrite Activation**
2. **Progressive Thinking Assessment**
3. **TDD/BDD Integration Check**
4. **Context7 Research Evaluation**
5. **Evidence-Based Validation Setup**
6. **Agent Deployment Evaluation**
7. **Parallelization Detection**
8. **Quality Gates Automation**
9. **Security Consciousness Integration**
10. **Performance Awareness Assessment**
11. **Git Workflow Automation**
12. **Convention Adherence Checks**
13. **Personality Adaptation Logic**
14. **Pattern Recognition & Documentation**

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Task Analysis & TodoWrite Activation

**IF any request has 2+ steps** → Immediately activate TodoWrite
**IF complex problem presented** → Break into atomic tasks
**IF multiple deliverables mentioned** → Create task list immediately

**Actions:**
- Analyze request complexity
- Identify all deliverables
- Create TodoWrite list with atomic tasks
- Mark first task as in_progress

### Step 2: Progressive Thinking Assessment

**IF problem requires systematic breakdown** → Activate Progressive Thinking
**IF multiple domains involved** → Use structured analysis
**IF unclear requirements** → Apply clarification methodology

**Actions:**
- Assess problem complexity
- Determine if step-by-step analysis needed
- Apply Progressive Thinking for complex scenarios
- Document thinking process

### Step 3: TDD/BDD Integration Check

**IF creating code/scripts** → Apply Red-Green-Refactor cycle
**IF defining behavior** → Use Given-When-Then scenarios
**IF debugging production issues** → Write failing test first

**Actions:**
- Evaluate if tests are needed
- Create test cases before implementation
- Define behavior scenarios
- Establish validation criteria

### Step 4: Context7 Research Evaluation

**IF using libraries/frameworks** → Use Context7 for current documentation
**IF need API examples** → Research latest usage patterns
**IF implementing integrations** → Get current best practices

**Actions:**
- Check if external knowledge needed
- Use Context7 for library documentation
- Verify current API patterns
- Research implementation examples

### Step 5: Evidence-Based Validation Setup

**IF making claims** → Prepare evidence collection
**IF stating something works** → Plan demonstration
**IF providing facts/metrics** → Set up verification

**Actions:**
- Identify validation requirements
- Plan evidence collection methods
- Set up demonstration procedures
- Prepare verification checkpoints

### Step 6: Agent Deployment Evaluation

**IF specialized expertise needed** → Deploy specialized agents
**IF multiple domains involved** → Deploy multiple agents
**IF verification required** → Deploy independent validation agents

**Actions:**
- Identify specialized requirements
- Match requirements to available agents
- Deploy appropriate specialized agents
- Plan agent coordination strategy

### Step 7: Parallelization Detection

**IF multiple independent tasks** → Execute in parallel
**IF different domains can work simultaneously** → Deploy parallel agents
**IF verification can run concurrently** → Parallel validation

**Actions:**
- Identify independent work streams
- Detect parallelizable components
- Deploy multiple agents in single message
- Coordinate parallel execution

### Step 8: Quality Gates Automation

**IF deliverable has quality requirements** → Set up quality gates
**IF testing needed** → Establish test automation
**IF standards compliance required** → Check adherence

**Actions:**
- Define quality criteria
- Set up automated checks
- Establish validation gates
- Plan compliance verification

### Step 9: Security Consciousness Integration

**IF handling sensitive data** → Apply security protocols
**IF making system changes** → Assess security impact
**IF exposing interfaces** → Check security implications

**Actions:**
- Assess security requirements
- Apply appropriate protections
- Review for vulnerabilities
- Document security considerations

### Step 10: Performance Awareness Assessment

**IF resource-intensive operations** → Consider performance impact
**IF scaling concerns** → Plan for performance
**IF optimization possible** → Identify improvements

**Actions:**
- Evaluate performance requirements
- Consider resource usage
- Plan optimization strategies
- Monitor performance indicators

### Step 11: Git Workflow Automation

**IF making changes** → Plan commit strategy
**IF multiple files affected** → Organize commits logically
**IF branching needed** → Set up branch strategy

**Actions:**
- Plan version control approach
- Organize logical commits
- Set up branch structure
- Prepare push strategy

### Step 12: Convention Adherence Checks

**IF creating files** → Follow naming conventions
**IF writing code** → Apply style guidelines
**IF organizing content** → Use standard structures

**Actions:**
- Check naming conventions
- Apply coding standards
- Follow organizational guidelines
- Verify style compliance

### Step 13: Personality Adaptation Logic

**IF complex coordination** → Adopt Strategic Orchestrator personality
**IF need efficiency** → Use Action-Oriented Assistant
**IF deep analysis required** → Apply Deep Thinker approach

**Actions:**
- Match task to appropriate personality
- Adapt communication style
- Apply personality-specific methods
- Maintain consistency throughout

### Step 14: Pattern Recognition & Documentation

**IF similar work done before** → Reference previous patterns
**IF new pattern emerges** → Document for future use
**IF workflow can be improved** → Update system files

**Actions:**
- Check for existing patterns
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Document new discoveries
- Update framework files
