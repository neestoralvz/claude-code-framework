# Context7 Integration Workflow

**Context**: TDD/BDD workflow for systematic use of Context7 for library documentation, best practices, and current examples

---

This workflow ensures Context7 is used effectively with validation at every step, providing current, accurate documentation and examples for development tasks.

## BDD Scenario: Context7 Usage

```gherkin
Given I need current library documentation or examples
When I use Context7 integration workflow
Then I should:
- Identify the specific library and use case
- Resolve correct Context7 library ID
- Retrieve relevant, current documentation
- Validate information accuracy with tests
- Apply knowledge with evidence-based implementation
```

## Phase 1: Requirement Discovery (BDD)

### Identify Documentation Needs
```gherkin
Given I need to work with libraries or frameworks
When I analyze my documentation requirements
Then I must:
- Define specific library/framework needed
- Identify exact use case or functionality
- Specify current version requirements
- Plan validation of retrieved information
```

**Actions:**
1. Write BDD scenario for the documentation need
2. Document specific questions to answer
3. Define success criteria for information quality
4. Plan validation tests for retrieved docs

### Library Identification Test
```javascript
describe('Library Identification', () => {
  it('should identify exact library needed', () => {
    // Test that library name is specific and resolvable
  });
  
  it('should define specific use case', () => {
    // Test that use case is clear and actionable
  });
  
  it('should specify version requirements', () => {
    // Test that version needs are documented
  });
});
```

## Phase 2: Context7 Resolution (TDD)

### Library ID Resolution
```gherkin
Given I have identified needed library
When I resolve Context7 library ID
Then I should:
- Use resolve-library-id function first
- Validate returned library ID format
- Confirm library matches my needs
- Document resolution for future use
```

**TDD Process:**
1. **Red Phase**: Write test expecting specific library ID format
2. **Green Phase**: Use Context7 resolve-library-id to get actual ID
3. **Refactor Phase**: Validate and document the resolved ID

### Resolution Validation Test
```javascript
describe('Context7 Library Resolution', () => {
  it('should resolve to valid Context7 ID format', () => {
    // Test ID follows /org/project or /org/project/version pattern
  });
  
  it('should match intended library', () => {
    // Test resolved library is the one we actually need
  });
  
  it('should provide current version', () => {
    // Test library version is recent and relevant
  });
});
```

## Phase 3: Documentation Retrieval (TDD/BDD)

### Focused Documentation Retrieval
```gherkin
Given I have valid Context7 library ID
When I retrieve documentation
Then I should:
- Specify focused topic for relevance
- Set appropriate token limit for depth
- Validate documentation completeness
- Test examples for accuracy
```

**TDD Approach:**
1. **Red Phase**: Write test for expected documentation structure
2. **Green Phase**: Retrieve docs with Context7 get-library-docs
3. **Refactor Phase**: Process and organize information

### Documentation Quality Tests
```javascript
describe('Retrieved Documentation', () => {
  it('should contain relevant examples', () => {
    // Test that docs include working code examples
  });
  
  it('should be current and up-to-date', () => {
    // Test that information reflects current best practices
  });
  
  it('should answer specific questions', () => {
    // Test that retrieved docs address our use case
  });
  
  it('should include API documentation', () => {
    // Test that API usage patterns are documented
  });
});
```

## Phase 4: Information Validation (BDD)

### Accuracy Verification
```gherkin
Given I have retrieved Context7 documentation
When I validate the information
Then I must:
- Test code examples in real environment
- Verify API signatures are current
- Validate best practices against community standards
- Cross-reference with official documentation
```

**Validation Process:**
- [ ] Code examples execute without errors
- [ ] API calls work with current library version
- [ ] Dependencies are correctly specified
- [ ] Performance recommendations are current

### Example Validation Test
```javascript
describe('Context7 Documentation Validation', () => {
  it('should have working code examples', () => {
    // Test that provided examples actually execute
  });
  
  it('should use current API patterns', () => {
    // Test that API usage matches library version
  });
  
  it('should include error handling', () => {
    // Test that examples show proper error handling
  });
});
```

## Phase 5: Implementation Application (TDD)

### Evidence-Based Implementation
```gherkin
Given I have validated Context7 documentation
When I implement the solution
Then I should:
- Follow documented patterns exactly
- Test implementation against examples
- Validate performance characteristics
- Document any adaptations needed
```

**Implementation TDD:**
1. **Red Phase**: Write tests based on Context7 examples
2. **Green Phase**: Implement following documented patterns
3. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize while maintaining documented approach

## Context7 Integration Patterns

### Library Research Pattern
```gherkin
Scenario: Researching new library integration
Given I need to integrate a new library
When I follow Context7 workflow
Then I should:
1. Use resolve-library-id with library name
2. Get focused documentation with specific topic
3. Validate examples in test environment
4. Implement with TDD following patterns
5. Document integration patterns for team
```

### Best Practices Discovery
```gherkin
Scenario: Finding current best practices
Given I need to improve existing code
When I use Context7 for best practices
Then I should:
1. Identify specific improvement areas
2. Research current patterns with Context7
3. Compare existing code against best practices
4. Test improvements incrementally
5. Validate performance and maintainability gains
```

### API Integration Pattern
```gherkin
Scenario: Implementing API integration
Given I need to work with external APIs
When I use Context7 for API documentation
Then I should:
