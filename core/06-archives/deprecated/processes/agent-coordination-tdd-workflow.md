# Agent Coordination TDD Workflow

**Context**: Comprehensive workflow for integrating Test-Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development with specialized agent coordination and multi-agent validation

**Purpose**: Ensure all agent coordination follows TDD/BDD principles with evidence-based validation, cross-agent testing, and systematic quality assurance

---

## BDD Foundation: Agent Coordination Behavior

### Primary Behavior Scenario
```gherkin
Given I have a complex task requiring multiple specialized agents
When I apply Agent Coordination TDD Workflow
Then I should:
- Create BDD scenarios for overall task behavior
- Design TDD tests for each agent's expected outputs
- Coordinate parallel agent execution with evidence
- Validate cross-agent integration with tests
- Deliver verified solution with comprehensive evidence
```

### Agent Validation Scenario
```gherkin
Given I deploy multiple specialized agents
When each agent completes their assigned tasks
Then each agent must:
- Provide evidence of TDD/BDD compliance
- Pass cross-validation tests with other agents
- Demonstrate behavior through working examples
- Supply test results and validation evidence
```

### Cross-Agent Integration Scenario
```gherkin
Given multiple agents produce interdependent outputs
When I coordinate agent integration
Then I must:
- Create integration tests before agent deployment
- Validate agent output compatibility
- Test combined system behavior
- Prove end-to-end functionality works
```

## Phase 1: Multi-Agent BDD Planning (15-25 minutes)

### Objectives
- Define overall system behavior using BDD scenarios
- Create testable acceptance criteria for multi-agent coordination
- Establish validation framework for agent interactions
- Design evidence collection strategy

### Activities

#### 1.1 Overall System Behavior Definition
```gherkin
Given [current system state]
When [multiple agents coordinate on complex task]
Then [system should deliver integrated solution]
And [all quality gates should pass]
And [evidence should demonstrate success]
```

**BDD Planning Process:**
1. **Stakeholder Story Analysis**
   - Define user value and business outcomes
   - Identify system-level behaviors needed
   - Map behaviors to agent specializations
   - Create acceptance scenarios

2. **Agent Interaction Scenarios**
   - Define how agents should coordinate
   - Specify handoff behaviors between agents
   - Establish conflict resolution scenarios
   - Design parallel execution behaviors

3. **Quality Behavior Scenarios**
   - Define what "quality" means for integrated output
   - Specify validation behaviors across agents
   - Establish evidence collection behaviors
   - Design regression protection scenarios

#### 1.2 Agent Specialization BDD Design

**Agent Assignment BDD Template:**
```gherkin
Given [specific domain expertise requirement]
When [I assign task to specialized agent]
Then [agent should produce expected deliverable]
And [deliverable should pass domain-specific tests]
And [deliverable should integrate with other agents' work]
```

**Agent Validation BDD Template:**
```gherkin
Given [agent produces output]
When [output is validated]
Then [output should meet functional requirements]
And [output should pass quality gates]
And [output should provide evidence of correctness]
And [output should not conflict with other agents]
```

#### 1.3 Integration Behavior Design

**Cross-Agent Integration BDD:**
```gherkin
Given [multiple agents complete individual tasks]
When [outputs are integrated into unified solution]
Then [integrated solution should work as complete system]
And [no agent conflicts should exist]
And [all requirements should be satisfied]
And [system should demonstrate expected behavior]
```

### Deliverables
- Overall system BDD scenarios
- Agent-specific behavior scenarios
- Integration behavior specifications
- Quality validation scenarios
- Evidence collection requirements

## Phase 2: TDD Test Design for Agent Coordination (20-35 minutes)

        - combined_functionality: test_result
        - no_conflicts: test_result
        - quality_consistency: test_result
```

**Cross-Validation Process:**
1. **Interface Validation**
   ```gherkin
   Given Agent A produces output with specific interface
   When Agent B consumes that output
   Then Agent B should process it without errors
   And combined behavior should work correctly
   ```

2. **Quality Consistency Validation**
   ```gherkin
   Given all agents complete their tasks
   When quality standards are measured across outputs
   Then all outputs should meet minimum quality thresholds
   And quality should be consistent across agents
   ```

3. **Integration Readiness Validation**
   ```gherkin
   Given all agents have completed individual validation
   When integration readiness is assessed
   Then all agents should be ready for integration
   And no blocking issues should exist
   ```

#### 4.2 System Integration Testing

**Integration Test Execution:**
```javascript
describe('System Integration Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Ensure all agents have passed individual validation
    agents.forEach(agent => {
      expect(agent.validationStatus).toBe('passed');
    });
  });
  
  it('should successfully integrate all agent outputs', () => {
    const integratedSystem = integrateAgentOutputs(agents);
    expect(integratedSystem).toBeDefined();
    expect(integratedSystem.errors).toEqual([]);
    expect(integratedSystem.functionality).toBeWorking();
  });
  
  it('should demonstrate end-to-end system behavior', () => {
    const systemDemo = runSystemDemo();
    expect(systemDemo).toShowExpectedBehavior();
    expect(systemDemo).toMeetAllRequirements();
  });
  
  it('should maintain quality across integrated system', () => {
    const systemQuality = assessIntegratedQuality();
    expect(systemQuality.overall).toBeGreaterThan(qualityThreshold);
    expect(systemQuality.consistency).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

#### 4.3 Evidence Integration and Validation

**Comprehensive Evidence Package:**
```yaml
integrated_evidence_package:
  individual_agent_evidence:
    - agent_specific_validation: per_agent_proof
    - tdd_compliance_proof: test_driven_development_evidence
    - bdd_compliance_proof: behavior_driven_development_evidence
  cross_agent_evidence:
    - compatibility_proof: cross_validation_results

    - end_to_end_functionality: complete_system_works
    - acceptance_criteria: all_requirements_satisfied
    - regression_protection: existing_functionality_preserved
    - comprehensive_evidence: complete_evidence_package

**Restart Criteria:**
- Any quality gate failure requires immediate attention and resolution
- Evidence gaps require agent re-deployment with corrected requirements
- Integration failures require compatibility analysis and remediation
- Less than 100% compliance triggers process restart with enhanced requirements
