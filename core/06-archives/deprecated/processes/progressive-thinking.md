# Progressive Thinking

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns



Deploy specialized agents to break complex tasks into manageable steps and build understanding progressively.

**MANDATORY**: All progressive thinking activities must be performed through agent deployment. Never attempt direct analysis or implementation.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Map the Current State

**Deploy analysis-specialist** to understand the current situation:

**Agent Instructions**: "Analyze current state of [system/problem]:
- Identify what we have now
- List what needs to change
- Understand the scope of work
- Document findings comprehensively"

### Step 2: Define the Target State

**Deploy requirements-analysis-specialist** to define objectives:

**Agent Instructions**: "Define target state for [system/problem]:
- Clarify what we want to achieve
- Set clear success criteria
- Identify key milestones
- Create measurable objectives"

### Step 3: Find the Path

**Deploy strategic-orchestrator** to plan execution path:

**Agent Instructions**: "Create execution plan for [project]:
- Break work into logical chunks
- Sequence tasks by dependencies
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Deploy appropriate specialists for each chunk"

### Step 4: Execute and Adjust

**Deploy project-management-specialist** to coordinate execution:

**Agent Instructions**: "Manage execution of [project]:
- Deploy specialists for each task systematically
- Track progress with TodoWrite tool
- Monitor results and adjust approach
- Coordinate agent deployments based on learnings"

## When to Use
- Complex reorganization tasks
- Multi-step implementations
- When tasks have dependencies
- When scope is large or unclear
