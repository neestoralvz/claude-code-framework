# Complexity Assessment Standards

**Context**: Systematic evaluation criteria for problem complexity to ensure appropriate methodology selection

**Purpose**: Provide consistent, objective criteria for assessing problem complexity and selecting appropriate response strategies

---

## Assessment Framework

### Mandatory Assessment Dimensions

**All Problem Assessments Must Evaluate**:
1. **Scope Impact**: Number of domains, systems, or areas affected
2. **Stakeholder Complexity**: Number and diversity of people involved
3. **Uncertainty Level**: Degree of unknowns in requirements or solutions
4. **Risk Level**: Consequences of failure or suboptimal solutions
5. **Timeline Pressure**: Urgency and scheduling constraints

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Initial Scoring (5 minutes maximum)

**Assessment Protocol**:
1. **Rapid Evaluation**: Score each dimension independently
2. **Evidence Gathering**: Note specific factors supporting each score
3. **Dimension Totaling**: Sum scores across all five dimensions
4. **Complexity Classification**: Apply total score to complexity categories

**Scoring Documentation Format**:
```yaml
complexity_assessment:
  problem_statement: "[Clear description of the problem]"
  assessment_date: "[Date of assessment]"
  assessor: "[Person conducting assessment]"
  
  dimension_scores:
    scope_impact: [1-10]
    stakeholder_complexity: [1-10]
    uncertainty_level: [1-10]
    risk_level: [1-10]
    timeline_pressure: [1-10]
  
  evidence_summary:
    scope_impact: "[Specific factors supporting score]"
    stakeholder_complexity: "[Stakeholder details and complexities]"
    uncertainty_level: "[Known unknowns and ambiguities]"
    risk_level: "[Potential consequences and impacts]"
    timeline_pressure: "[Deadline and timing constraints]"
  
  total_score: [5-50]
  complexity_classification: "[Simple/Moderate/High]"
  methodology_recommendation: "[Suggested approach based on complexity]"
```

### Step 2: Classification Application

**Complexity Categories**:
```yaml

      - well_understood_requirements
      - low_risk_consequences
      - flexible_timeline
    recommended_approach: "Direct implementation with basic analysis"
    
  moderate_complexity:
    score_range: 16-35
    characteristics:
      - multi_domain_interactions
      - multiple_stakeholder_groups
      - some_requirement_unknowns
      - moderate_risk_level
      - balanced_timeline_pressure
    recommended_approach: "Structured analysis with coordinated execution"
    
  high_complexity:
    score_range: 36-50
    characteristics:
      - systems_wide_impact
      - complex_stakeholder_networks
      - significant_uncertainties
      - high_risk_consequences
      - critical_timeline_constraints
    recommended_approach: "Comprehensive strategic analysis and coordination"
```

### Step 3: Methodology Selection

**Methodology Mapping**:
```yaml

    - fishbone_diagram_analysis
    - design_thinking_approach
    - multi_stakeholder_coordination
    - evidence_based_validation
    - comprehensive_documentation
    
  high_complexity_methods:
    - fault_tree_analysis
    - mdmp_adaptation
    - parallel_agent_coordination

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Assessment Validation Requirements

**Mandatory Validation Checks**:
- [ ] All five dimensions assessed and scored
- [ ] Evidence provided for each dimension score
- [ ] Total score calculated correctly
- [ ] Complexity classification matches score range
- [ ] Methodology recommendation aligns with complexity level

**Assessment Review Criteria**:
- **Consistency**: Scores align with provided evidence
- **Completeness**: All relevant factors considered

### Reassessment Triggers

**Mandatory Reassessment Conditions**:
- New stakeholders or requirements emerge
- Risk level changes during execution
- Timeline pressure increases or decreases significantly
- Solution approach proves inadequate for complexity
- Scope expands or contracts substantially

**Reassessment Process**:
1. **Trigger Recognition**: Identify need for complexity reassessment
2. **Updated Assessment**: Re-score affected dimensions with new information
3. **Classification Review**: Determine if complexity category changes
4. **Methodology Adjustment**: Update approach if complexity category changes
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Inform relevant parties of assessment changes
