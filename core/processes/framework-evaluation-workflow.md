# Framework Evaluation Workflow
**Context**: Systematic framework maintenance, evaluation, and optimization for continuous improvement
---

**IF reading individually** â†’ READ [PROCESSES.md](../PROCESSES.md#workflow-processes) for context, THEN navigate to this specific process


## When To Use
- Framework maintenance needed
- System optimization required
- Performance evaluation and improvement
- CLAUDE.md effectiveness assessment

## CLAUDE.md Evaluation Framework
Comprehensive evaluation and maintenance system deployed in work/20250820-claude-md-evaluation/ - Includes 9 evaluation question categories, 15 maintenance commands, automated success metrics, and 4-phase implementation strategy. Framework transforms CLAUDE.md from static preferences into self-optimizing system with evidence-based improvement capabilities.

## Systematic Framework Evaluation
When developing frameworks or preference systems, always include systematic evaluation capabilities from the start - Define measurable success criteria, create maintenance commands, implement automated monitoring, and design evolution mechanisms. Prevents framework degradation and enables continuous improvement through evidence-based optimization rather than subjective assessment.

## Evaluation Schedule
- **Monthly**: Use `claude-md-audit-effectiveness-full` for comprehensive framework assessment
- **Weekly**: Use `claude-md-report-status-dashboard` for systematic optimization monitoring
- **Session-based**: Continuous evaluation through session conclusion workflow

## Framework Evaluation Process

### 1. Performance Assessment
- Analyze framework effectiveness in supporting workflow
- Measure cognitive load reduction and efficiency gains
- Evaluate tool usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- Assess workflow completion rates and quality metrics

### 2. Content Optimization
- Review CLAUDE.md content relevance and usage patterns
- Identify unused or ineffective preferences
- Evaluate conditional loading effectiveness
- Optimize content organization and accessibility

### 3. System Integration
- Validate cross-system consistency and coherence
- Check link integrity and navigation effectiveness
- Assess framework component relationships
- Evaluate system maintenance overhead

### 4. Evidence-Based Improvements
- Generate improvement recommendations based on usage data
- Create implementation roadmaps for framework enhancements
- Validate changes through systematic testing
- Document optimization results and lessons learned

## Perpetual Evolution
Regularly audit and remove unused documentation, principles, and processes - maintain only what actively serves us to stay adaptable.

## Minimal Essential Documentation
Only document what's truly essential and relevant - avoid unnecessary details.

## Operations Insights Integration
Valuable strategic insights accumulate in work/ directory - these should be regularly reviewed and integrated into framework rather than left unprocessed.

## Evaluation Commands
The framework includes automated evaluation commands for systematic assessment:
- `claude-md-audit-effectiveness-full` - Comprehensive monthly evaluation
- `claude-md-report-status-dashboard` - Weekly optimization monitoring
- Various maintenance and optimization commands for specific areas

## Related Documentation
