# Framework Evaluation Workflow
**Context**: Systematic framework maintenance, evaluation, and optimization for continuous improvement
---

**IF reading individually** â†’ READ [PROCESSES.md](../PROCESSES.md#workflow-processes) for context, THEN navigate to this specific process


## When To Use
- Framework maintenance needed
- System optimization required
- Performance evaluation and improvement
- CLAUDE.md effectiveness assessment

## CLAUDE.md Evaluation Framework
Comprehensive evaluation and maintenance system deployed in work/20250820-claude-md-evaluation/ - Includes 9 evaluation question categories, 15 maintenance commands, automated success metrics, and 4-phase implementation strategy. Framework transforms CLAUDE.md from static preferences into self-optimizing system with evidence-based improvement capabilities.

## Systematic Framework Evaluation

**Deploy framework-analysis-specialist** to establish evaluation system:

**Agent Instructions**: "Create systematic evaluation for [framework]:
- Define measurable success criteria
- Create maintenance commands
- Implement automated monitoring
- Design evolution mechanisms"

Prevents framework degradation and enables continuous improvement through evidence-based optimization.

## Evaluation Schedule
- **Monthly**: Use `claude-md-audit-effectiveness-full` for comprehensive framework assessment
- **Weekly**: Use `claude-md-report-status-dashboard` for systematic optimization monitoring
- **Session-based**: Continuous evaluation through session conclusion workflow

## Framework Evaluation Process

### 1. Performance Assessment

**Deploy performance-analysis-specialist** to measure framework effectiveness:

**Agent Instructions**: "Assess [framework] performance:
- Analyze effectiveness in supporting workflow
- Measure cognitive load reduction and efficiency gains
- Evaluate tool usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- Assess workflow completion rates and quality metrics"

### 2. Content Optimization

**Deploy content-optimization-specialist** to improve framework content:

**Agent Instructions**: "Optimize [framework] content:
- Review CLAUDE.md content relevance and usage patterns
- Identify unused or ineffective preferences
- Evaluate conditional loading effectiveness
- Optimize content organization and accessibility"

### 3. System Integration

**Deploy integration-specialist** to validate system coherence:

**Agent Instructions**: "Validate [framework] integration:
- Check cross-system consistency and coherence
- Verify link integrity and navigation effectiveness
- Assess framework component relationships
- Evaluate system maintenance overhead"

### 4. Evidence-Based Improvements

**Deploy improvement-specialist** to implement enhancements:

**Agent Instructions**: "Implement [framework] improvements:
- Generate recommendations based on usage data
- Create implementation roadmaps for enhancements
- Deploy validation-specialist to test changes
- Document optimization results and lessons learned"

## Perpetual Evolution

**Deploy evolution-specialist** to maintain framework vitality:

**Agent Instructions**: "Evolve [framework] by auditing and removing unused documentation, principles, and processes - maintain only what actively serves to stay adaptable."

## Minimal Essential Documentation
Only document what's truly essential and relevant - avoid unnecessary details.

## Operations Insights Integration

**Deploy insights-integration-specialist** to harvest learnings:

**Agent Instructions**: "Review work/ directory for strategic insights and integrate valuable learnings into [framework] rather than leaving them unprocessed."

## Evaluation Commands
The framework includes automated evaluation commands for systematic assessment:
- `claude-md-audit-effectiveness-full` - Comprehensive monthly evaluation
- `claude-md-report-status-dashboard` - Weekly optimization monitoring
- Various maintenance and optimization commands for specific areas

## Related Documentation
When evaluating framework effectiveness, READ these files:
- **Evaluation System**: READ work/20250820-claude-md-evaluation/ for comprehensive evaluation methodology
- **Performance Metrics**: READ work/ for historical performance data and insights
- **System Standards**: READ core/STANDARDS.md for evaluation criteria and quality requirements
