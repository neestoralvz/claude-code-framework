# Extended Thinking Workflow

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns


How to deploy specialized agents to systematically work through complex problems that require deep analysis.

**MANDATORY**: All extended thinking must be performed through agent deployment. Never attempt direct analysis.

## When to Use Extended Thinking

When facing complex problems with multiple components, unclear requirements, or potential ripple effects. Use this for architectural decisions, debugging complex issues, or planning significant changes.

## Think Through the Problem

**Deploy deep-analysis-specialist** to decompose the problem:

**Agent Instructions**: "Analyze [complex problem] by:
- Breaking down into smaller components
- Identifying known facts and unknowns
- Documenting assumptions being made
- Mapping relationships between components"

## Explore Multiple Approaches

**Deploy solution-architect** to generate and evaluate approaches:

**Agent Instructions**: "Generate multiple solutions for [problem]:
- Create at least 3 distinct approaches
- Evaluate tradeoffs: complexity, maintainability, performance
- Consider future flexibility and scalability
- Recommend optimal approach with justification"

## Plan Implementation Steps

**Deploy strategic-orchestrator** to create detailed implementation plan:

**Agent Instructions**: "Create implementation plan for [chosen approach]:
- Break down into specific, actionable steps
- Identify dependencies between steps
- Map potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Define validation criteria for each step"

## Execute with Validation

**Deploy implementation-specialist** with continuous validation:

**Agent Instructions**: "Execute [implementation plan] with validation:
- Implement one step at a time
- Deploy validation-specialist after each step
- Catch and address problems immediately
- Adjust approach based on validation results"

## Reflect and Document

**Deploy documentation-specialist** to capture learnings:

**Agent Instructions**: "Document learnings from [project]:
- Capture what was learned
- Document what worked well
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Create knowledge base for future problems"
