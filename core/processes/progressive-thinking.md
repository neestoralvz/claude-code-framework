# Progressive Thinking

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns



Break complex tasks into manageable steps and build understanding progressively.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Map the Current State
- Identify what we have now
- List what needs to change
- Understand the scope of work

### Step 2: Define the Target State  
- Clarify what we want to achieve
- Set clear success criteria
- Identify key milestones

### Step 3: Find the Path
- Break work into logical chunks
- Sequence tasks by dependencies
- Identify what can be done in parallel

### Step 4: Execute and Adjust
- Work through tasks systematically
- Track progress with TodoWrite tool
- Adjust approach based on what we learn

## When to Use
- Complex reorganization tasks
- Multi-step implementations
- When tasks have dependencies
- When scope is large or unclear
