### Hierarchical Structure

```
system/
├── principles/        # Core framework principles
├── processes/         # Workflow definitions
└── templates/         # Implementation tools
```

### Organization Logic

1. **Principles** - What guides decisions
2. **Processes** - How work gets done  
3. **Templates** - Reusable tools

### File Naming Convention

- Lowercase with hyphens
- Descriptive purpose-based names
- Grouped by logical function
- Clear hierarchy from general to specific
