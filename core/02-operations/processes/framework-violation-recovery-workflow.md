# Framework Violation Recovery Workflow

**Context**: Crisis recovery workflow for systematic restoration of framework compliance

---

## Overview

This workflow provides systematic recovery procedures when framework rules and compliance are bypassed or violated. It focuses on immediate restoration and prevention of future violations.

## Immediate Recognition Phase

### Violation Detection Signals
- Direct implementation without Context7 research
- Bypassing agent deployment for specialized tasks
- Working without TodoWrite for multi-step processes
- Skipping TDD/BDD validation requirements
- Making changes without evidence demonstration

### Crisis Assessment
1. **Scope Analysis** - Identify extent of framework bypassing
2. **Impact Assessment** - Evaluate consequences of violations
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Detect systematic vs isolated violations
4. **Risk Evaluation** - Assess ongoing compliance risks

## Immediate Recovery Actions

### STOP Current Work
**MANDATORY**: Halt all current implementation activities immediately.

**Rationale**: Prevent further framework violations and ensure proper recovery.

### Context7 Research Requirement
**IF any library/framework implementation needed** → MUST use Context7 first:

```
Context7 Research Protocol:
1. Identify specific library/framework in use
2. Resolve library ID through Context7
3. Retrieve current documentation and best practices
4. Review implementation patterns and examples
5. Apply Context7 findings to current implementation
```

### Agent Deployment Recovery
**IF specialized work identified** → MUST deploy appropriate agents:

```
Agent Deployment Recovery Protocol:
1. Identify specialized domains requiring agents
2. Deploy Task tool with specialized agent instructions
3. Coordinate agent results systematically
4. Document agent deployment decisions
5. Validate agent effectiveness
```

### TodoWrite Implementation
**IF multi-step work identified** → MUST create TodoWrite tasks:

```
TodoWrite Recovery Protocol:
1. Break down all remaining work into atomic tasks
2. Mark current violation recovery as in_progress
3. Add Context7 research tasks as needed
4. Add agent deployment tasks as required
5. Include validation and testing tasks
```

## Systematic Framework Reintegration

### TDD/BDD Validation Recovery
```
Testing Recovery Protocol:
1. Write failing tests for current implementation state
2. Apply Red-Green-Refactor methodology
3. Implement Given-When-Then scenarios for behavior
4. Validate all functionality with passing tests
5. Document test outcomes as evidence
```

### Evidence-Based Validation
```
Evidence Recovery Protocol:
1. Document current implementation state
2. Run tests to verify functionality
3. Demonstrate working features with examples
4. Capture validation evidence (logs, outputs, tests)
5. Update documentation with evidence links
```

### Quality Gate Implementation
```
Quality Recovery Protocol:
1. Run linters and type checkers on modified code
2. Fix all quality violations identified
3. Implement defensive coding practices
4. Add error handling and input validation
5. Ensure code follows project conventions
```

## Learning Integration

### Violation Analysis
1. **Document the specific violations** that occurred
2. **Identify root causes** - why framework was bypassed
3. **Analyze trigger conditions** - what led to violations
4. **Review decision points** - where framework awareness failed

### Framework Reinforcement
1. **Update CLAUDE.md** with specific violation patterns
2. **Strengthen enforcement language** for violated areas
3. **Add automatic triggers** for compliance checking
4. **Create prevention checkpoints** for future work

### Process Improvement
1. **Identify framework gaps** that allowed violations
2. **Strengthen weak enforcement points**
3. **Add missing workflow connections**
4. **Update process documentation** with lessons learned

## Prevention Protocol

### Automatic Framework Activation
```
Prevention Activation Protocol:
1. Context7 MANDATORY for any library work
2. Agent deployment MANDATORY for specialized tasks
3. TodoWrite MANDATORY for multi-step processes
4. TDD/BDD MANDATORY for implementation work
5. Evidence demonstration MANDATORY for all claims
```

### Compliance Monitoring
1. **Pre-implementation checks** - verify framework requirements met
2. **Mid-implementation validation** - ensure ongoing compliance
3. **Post-implementation verification** - confirm framework adherence
4. **Continuous monitoring** - detect early violation signals

### Recovery Readiness
1. **Maintain recovery workflow awareness**
2. **Practice violation recognition skills**
3. **Keep framework documentation current**
4. **Regular framework compliance audits**

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All current violations identified and documented
- [ ] Context7 research completed for relevant libraries
- [ ] Appropriate agents deployed for specialized work
- [ ] TodoWrite tasks created for remaining work
- [ ] TDD/BDD validation implemented with passing tests
- [ ] Evidence documented for all implementations
- [ ] Framework reinforcement updates made to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Prevention protocols activated for future work

## Emergency Escalation

**IF recovery workflow insufficient** → Deploy System Guardian personality for framework protection:

**System Guardian Activation**: "Framework compliance violations detected. Implement emergency framework restoration with maximum enforcement of Context7, agent deployment, and validation requirements."

**Remember**: Framework violations indicate system failure. Recovery must be complete and systematic to prevent future occurrences.
