## Quick Decision Guide

**Use this matrix to select the right workflow for your task. Match your situation to the criteria below.**

## Command-Workflow-Agent Integration

### Slash Commands → Workflows → Agents

| Command | Primary Workflow | Secondary Workflows | Key Agents | When to Use |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| `/recenter` | [RECENTER](../processes/recenter-workflow.md) | All patterns activated | system-enhancement-specialist | Lost in complexity, need optimization reset |
| `/project [name]` | [Project Documentation](../processes/project-documentation-workflow.md) | Strategic Orchestration, TodoWrite | documentation-curator, strategic-operations-orchestrator | Starting new project, need structured planning |
| `/done` | [Session Conclusion](../processes/session-conclusion-workflow.md) | Validation & Demonstration | system-maintenance-validator | Ending work session, need cleanup |

### Progressive Thinking Levels → Agent Deployment

## Workflow Combination Patterns

### Standard Combinations
- **RECENTER + TDD/BDD** → For all code work
- **Strategic Orchestration + Agent Creation** → For complex multi-agent tasks
- **Validation + TDD/BDD** → For proving code works
- **Context7 + Web Research + Evidence-Based** → For research tasks
- **Progressive Thinking + TodoWrite** → For complex planning

### Advanced Combinations
- **Strategic Orchestration + Parallel Agent Coordination + TDD/BDD** → Complex multi-domain development
- **Agent Creation + Strategic Orchestration + Validation** → Building and deploying specialized systems
- **RECENTER + Progressive Thinking + Strategic Orchestration** → Complex strategic analysis
