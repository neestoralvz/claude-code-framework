**IF creating validation reports** â†’ READ [evidence-patterns.md](../standards/evidence-patterns.md) for evidence collection standards, THEN use this template for systematic validation reporting


# Validation Report Template

**Context**: Standardized template for validation reporting with integrated TDD/BDD methodology and evidence-based validation

---

This template ensures consistent, comprehensive validation reporting that integrates Given-When-Then scenarios, Red-Green-Refactor cycles, and evidence-based quality validation.

## Report Metadata

```yaml
validation_report:
  report_id: "VR-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS"
  work_type: [code|documentation|testing|research|integration]
  work_item_id: "[ticket/issue/feature identifier]"
  validator: "[name/role]"
  validation_date: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
  validation_environment: "[development|staging|production]"
  framework_version: "[TDD/BDD framework version]"
  evidence_location: "[path to evidence directory]"
```

---

## Executive Summary

### Validation Outcome
- **Overall Status**: [PASS|FAIL|CONDITIONAL_PASS|BLOCKED]
- **Quality Gate Compliance**: [X/Y gates passed]
- **Critical Issues**: [count of blocking issues]
- **Recommendation**: [APPROVE|REJECT|REQUIRES_REWORK|CONDITIONAL_APPROVAL]

### Key Metrics Summary
```yaml
metrics_summary:
  test_coverage: "XX.X%"
  defect_density: "X.X defects/KLOC"
  performance_impact: "+/-X.X%"
  documentation_completeness: "XX.X%"
  quality_score: "XX.X/100"
```

## BDD Scenario Validation

### Primary Business Scenario
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature/Work Item Name]
  As a [user/role]
  I want [capability/feature]
  So that [business value/outcome]

Scenario: [Primary Success Scenario]
  Given [initial system state/context]
  When [user action/trigger event]
  Then [expected system behavior/outcome]
  And [additional success criteria]
  But [constraints/limitations]

Validation Result: [PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL]
Evidence: [link to supporting evidence]
Notes: [any relevant observations]
```

### Alternative Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: [Edge Cases/Alternative Paths]
  Given [context with variables]
  When [action with <parameters>]
  Then [expected outcome with <results>]

Examples:
  | parameters | results   | validation_status |
  | value1     | result1   | PASS             |
  | value2     | result2   | PASS             |
  | value3     | result3   | FAIL             |
```

### Error Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: [Error Handling Validation]
  Given [system in error-prone state]
  When [error condition occurs]
  Then [system should handle error gracefully]
  And [user should receive appropriate feedback]
  And [system should recover/maintain stability]

Validation Result: [PASS|FAIL]
Evidence: [error logs, recovery evidence]
```
