# Project Documentation Template

_Template for documenting project objectives, challenges, success criteria, and metrics_

## Project Overview

### Overall Objective
**What is the main goal of this project?**
- [ ] Define the primary objective in 1-2 clear sentences
- [ ] Explain what success looks like at a high level
- [ ] Identify the ultimate value this project will deliver

### Specific Objectives
**What are the concrete, measurable goals?**
- [ ] List 3-5 specific objectives
- [ ] Make each objective SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- [ ] Prioritize objectives by importance/urgency
- [ ] Define dependencies between objectives

### Challenge Definition
**What problem are we solving?**
- [ ] Describe the current problem/pain point
- [ ] Explain why this problem needs to be solved now
- [ ] Identify who is affected by this problem
- [ ] Quantify the impact of the problem (if possible)
- [ ] List any constraints or limitations we're working within

## Success Criteria

### Completion Criteria
**How will we know the project is complete?**
- [ ] Define specific deliverables
- [ ] Set quality standards for each deliverable
- [ ] Establish acceptance criteria
- [ ] Define "done" for each major component

### Success Metrics
**How will we measure success?**
- [ ] Identify quantitative metrics (performance, usage, etc.)
- [ ] Define qualitative measures (user satisfaction, etc.)
- [ ] Set target values for each metric
- [ ] Establish measurement methods and frequency
- [ ] Define baseline values (current state)

## Documentation Maintenance

### Initial Documentation
- [ ] Fill out all sections completely at project start
- [ ] Review and validate with stakeholders
- [ ] Store in appropriate project location
- [ ] Link to from main project documentation

### Ongoing Updates
- [ ] Review metrics weekly/monthly
- [ ] Update criteria when scope changes
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Track progress against objectives

## Template Usage Instructions

### When to Use This Template
- **IF starting new project** → Use this template immediately
- **IF project scope changes** → Update relevant sections
- **IF need project alignment** → Review this document with stakeholders
- **IF measuring progress** → Check against success metrics

### How to Customize
1. **Replace placeholders** with actual project details
2. **Adjust metrics** based on project type and scale
3. **Add sections** if project has unique requirements
4. **Remove sections** that don't apply to your project

### File Naming Convention
Use format: `PROJECT-[project-name]-[YYYYMMDD].md`
- Example: `PROJECT-user-authentication-system-20250820.md`
- Store in `docs/` directory or project-specific location

## Example Project Documentation

### Sample: User Authentication System

#### Overall Objective
Implement a secure, scalable user authentication system that provides seamless login/logout functionality while protecting user data and maintaining system performance.

#### Specific Objectives
1. **Authentication Implementation** (Priority 1)
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Support email/password and OAuth2 login
   - Complete by: 2025-09-15

2. **Security Standards** (Priority 1)
   - Implement rate limiting and security headers
   - Pass security audit with zero critical vulnerabilities
   - Complete by: 2025-09-10

3. **Performance Requirements** (Priority 2)
   - Login response time under 500ms
   - Support 1000+ concurrent users
   - Complete by: 2025-09-20

#### Challenge Definition
Current system uses session-based authentication that doesn't scale across multiple servers and lacks proper security measures. Users experience frequent logouts and security concerns are increasing.

#### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Login time < 500ms (baseline: 2000ms)
- **Security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities (baseline: 3 critical)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime (baseline: 95%)
- **User Experience**: Login success rate > 99% (baseline: 85%)
