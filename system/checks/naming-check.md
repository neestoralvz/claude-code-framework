# Naming Check

**Context**: Validation check ensuring framework integrity and compliance


**[System](../INDEX.md) › [Checks](../CHECKS.md) › Naming Check**

Verify names follow our simple naming standard.

- Is it lowercase with hyphens?
- Is it descriptive and clear?
- Is it as short as possible while staying clear?
- Does it avoid unnecessary words?
- Would someone immediately understand what it contains?
