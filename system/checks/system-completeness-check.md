# System Completeness Check

**Context**: Validation check for overall framework integrity and component completeness

## System Completeness Validation Criteria

Verify the framework contains all necessary components and functions as a complete system.

### Core Component Checks
- Are all main framework files present (CLAUDE.md, INDEX.md, etc.)?
- Do all expected directories exist in system/?
- Are mandatory components like principles, processes present?
- Are there missing critical framework elements?

### Integration Checks
- Do all components work together coherently?
- Are there integration gaps between components?
- Do workflows span the complete framework?
- Are there isolated or disconnected elements?

### Functionality Checks
- Can users accomplish all intended framework tasks?
- Are all use cases covered by existing components?
- Do tools and processes support all workflows?
- Are there functional gaps or limitations?

### Documentation Checks
- Is framework usage completely documented?
- Are all components explained and accessible?
- Do examples cover key framework features?
- Is onboarding information complete?

### Evolution Checks
- Can the framework adapt to new requirements?
- Are extension points clearly defined?
- Is the framework maintainable long-term?
- Are there scalability considerations addressed?
