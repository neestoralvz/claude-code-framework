# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working Directory Restriction

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL work must be performed exclusively within the `/Users/nalve/.claude/docs/principles` directory. Do not access, modify, or create files outside this principles directory under any circumstances.

## Repository Overview

This is the **Claude Code Framework Principles Directory** - a comprehensive philosophical foundation that governs the entire Claude Code Framework through systematic principles, validation methodologies, and architectural guidance. The principles directory serves as the authoritative source for all framework behavior, execution patterns, and quality standards.

### Architecture

The principles system implements a **hierarchical authority structure** with clear dependency chains:

- **Ultimate Authority**: `../core-authority/directive.md` - Core command framework and execution rules
- **Systematic Execution**: `../core-authority/workflow.md` - 10-phase mandatory execution methodology  
- **Foundational Philosophy**: `../core-authority/fundamental.md` - Simplicity and evidence-based approach
- **Technical Standards**: `engineering.md` - Quality requirements and implementation patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: `validation.md` - Comprehensive validation and compliance methodology

### Key Components

#### Core Operating Principles
- `../core-authority/directive.md` - Primary execution framework with authority hierarchy
- `../core-authority/workflow.md` - 10-phase systematic execution methodology (MANDATORY phases 1-10)
- `../core-authority/fundamental.md` - Simplicity principles and evidence requirements
- `validation.md` - Four-gate validation system and quality assurance

#### Agent & Task Orchestration  
- `agent-definition.md` - Agent architecture and specialization boundaries
- `agent-selection.md` - Agent deployment and coordination strategies
- `task-orchestration.md` - Multi-agent coordination patterns
- `task-tool-syntax.md` - Task tool invocation framework

#### Framework Integration
- `claude-md.md` - Claude.md generation and management standards
- `git-workflow.md` - Version control integration patterns
- `command-workflow-principles.md` - Command workflow integration
- `workflow-support-operations.md` - Support operation patterns

#### Content & Communication
- `communication.md` - Direct communication standards (max 4 lines response)
- `formatting.md` - Documentation formatting and presentation standards
- `files.md` - File management and naming conventions
- `expert-documentation.md` - Technical documentation standards

## Common Development Tasks

### Working with Principles

**Directory Restriction**: All principle work must remain within `/Users/nalve/.claude/docs/principles` directory only.

**Validate Principle Compliance:**
```bash
# Check principle validation (no specific command - analysis-based)
# Principles are validated through systematic review and compliance checking
# All validation work restricted to principles directory only
```

**Apply Principle Authority Hierarchy:**
1. Load `../core-authority/directive.md` as ultimate authority
2. Apply `../core-authority/workflow.md` for 10-phase execution (MANDATORY)
3. Follow `../core-authority/fundamental.md` for simplicity and evidence
4. Implement `engineering.md` for technical standards
5. Use `validation.md` for quality assurance

**Principle Development Pattern:**
1. **Authority Declaration**: Define principle scope with authority marker
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Declare all dependencies in frontmatter
3. **Integration Points**: Define clear input/output relationships
4. **Validation Checkpoints**: Build-in compliance verification
5. **Cross-Reference**: Maintain link integrity across principles

### Validation Workflow

**Four-Gate Validation System (from validation.md):**
1. **Requirements Gate** - Verify specifications before execution
2. **Process Gate** - Confirm methodology compliance during execution  
3. **Output Gate** - Validate deliverable quality upon completion
4. **System Gate** - Ensure framework integrity across components

**Progressive Thinking Requirements:**
- **Simple Tasks (1-10 min)**: Think → Think Hard minimum
- **Moderate Tasks (10-30 min)**: Think → Think Hard → Think Harder minimum
- **Complex Tasks (30+ min)**: Full Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → UltraThink MANDATORY
- **Enterprise Tasks (60+ min)**: Enhanced UltraThink with predictive analysis

### Agent Coordination

**Agent Selection Process:**
1. Analyze task complexity and domain requirements
2. Consult agent capability matrix and specialization domains
3. Deploy appropriate agents via Task tool orchestration
4. Coordinate multi-agent workflows for complex operations
5. Validate agent output against quality standards

**Orchestrator-Agent Pattern:**
- **Orchestrators**: Must use Task tools for agent deployment and coordination
- **Deployed Agents**: Execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob tools
- **Progressive Responsibility**: Orchestrator manages workflow → Agents execute solutions

## Framework Integration

### CLAUDE.md Integration
The principles directory works with the main CLAUDE.md through:
- **Authority Chain**: CLAUDE.md has ultimate operational authority
- **Principle Loading**: CLAUDE.md defines the principle application sequence
- **Framework Coordination**: Principles provide philosophical foundation for CLAUDE.md operations
- **Quality Integration**: Validation principles ensure CLAUDE.md execution quality

### Validation Requirements
All framework operations must satisfy:
- **10-Phase Workflow**: Sequential execution phases 1→2→3→4→5→6→7→8→9→10
- **Progressive Thinking**: Complexity-appropriate thinking levels for all operations
- **Four-Gate Validation**: Requirements → Process → Output → System validation
- **MANDATORY Recursion**: Failed validation requires recursive improvement until success
- **Evidence-Based**: Mathematical verification and objective validation criteria

### Quality Standards
- **Single Responsibility**: Each principle addresses one philosophical domain
- **Authority Clarity**: Clear scope definition with authority markers
- **Dependency Management**: Explicit dependency chains in frontmatter
- **Link Integrity**: Maintained cross-references across principle network
- **Validation Integration**: Built-in compliance and verification checkpoints

## Development Workflow

### Principle Modification Process
1. **Load Context**: Read ../core-authority/directive.md for authority framework
2. **Understand Dependencies**: Review principle dependency chain
3. **Plan Changes**: Design modifications with impact analysis
4. **Validate Integration**: Ensure compatibility with dependent principles
5. **Test Authority**: Verify authority hierarchy maintenance
6. **Update Cross-References**: Maintain link integrity across framework

### Framework Compliance
- **Follow Authority Hierarchy**: ../core-authority/directive.md → ../core-authority/workflow.md → ../core-authority/fundamental.md → engineering.md
- **Maintain Principle Boundaries**: Respect single responsibility per principle
- **Preserve Integration**: Keep cross-reference integrity across principle network
- **Validate Changes**: Apply four-gate validation to all modifications
- **Document Dependencies**: Update frontmatter with accurate dependency information

### Quality Assurance
- **Progressive Thinking**: Apply appropriate thinking complexity to all operations
- **Systematic Validation**: Use four-gate system for comprehensive quality assurance
- **Evidence Requirements**: Provide mathematical verification and objective criteria
- **Recursive Improvement**: Continue until complete validation success achieved
- **Authority Compliance**: Maintain deference to CLAUDE.md ultimate authority

## Important Notes

- **DIRECTORY RESTRICTION**: ALL work must remain exclusively within `/Users/nalve/.claude/docs/principles` directory
- **MANDATORY 10-Phase Workflow**: All operations must complete phases 1-10 sequentially
- **No Phase Skipping**: Cannot bypass any workflow phase under any circumstances
- **Orchestrator Restrictions**: Must use Task tools for agent deployment (cannot use Read, Edit, Write, Bash directly)
- **Progressive Thinking**: Complexity-based thinking levels required for all operations
- **Authority Deference**: All principles defer to main CLAUDE.md for operational directives
- **Validation Requirements**: Mathematical verification and evidence-based validation mandatory
- **Recursive Execution**: Failed validation requires complete workflow recursion until success
- **File Scope Limitation**: Only modify files within principles directory structure

This principles directory provides the philosophical foundation that governs all Claude Code Framework operations through systematic, validated, and hierarchically-organized principles that ensure consistent quality, comprehensive execution, and continuous improvement.
