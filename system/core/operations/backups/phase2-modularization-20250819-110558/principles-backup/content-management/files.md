# FILES

## Core Philosophy

⏺ **Principle**: File management serves controlled resource creation and modification within defined system boundaries.

**Why**: Uncontrolled file creation leads to system sprawl, maintenance burden, and unclear information architecture.

**What**: A constraint-based approach to file operations that prioritizes editing existing resources and minimizes unnecessary file proliferation.

## Fundamental Concepts

### Conservation Philosophy
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Create new files only when explicitly required
- Maintain minimal file system footprint

### Constraint Philosophy
- Operate within clearly defined scope boundaries
- Follow established workflow validation patterns
- Preserve existing system structure and relationships

### Purpose-Driven Philosophy
- Create documentation only when specifically requested
- Ensure every file serves a clear, defined purpose
- Avoid speculative or "just in case" file creation

## Implementation Framework

### File Management Implementation

**Execute systematic file management practices:**
- Prefer Edit tool over Write tool for all file modifications to preserve existing content
- Create new files only when absolutely necessary for achieving specific goals
- Validate file creation necessity against existing resources before proceeding with Write operations
- Apply consistent file naming conventions using descriptive, hyphen-separated lowercase names
- Implement logical directory structures following organizational hierarchy principles

**File Operation Standards:**
- Always read existing files first using Read tool before making modifications
- Use absolute file paths consistently throughout all operations and references
- Verify file necessity through systematic alternatives analysis before creating new resources
- Apply appropriate file extensions and formatting standards for content type consistency
- Maintain file system cleanliness by removing unnecessary or redundant resources

**Creation Constraint Enforcement:**
- Never proactively create documentation files without explicit user requests
- Avoid README file creation unless specifically requested by users
- Prevent speculative file creation for "potential future use" scenarios
- Ensure every new file serves immediate, defined purpose within project scope
- Document rationale for all new file creation in operational logs

⏺ **Relationship**: This file management principle controls resource creation across all operations:
- **[../core-authority/directive.md](../core-authority/directive.md)**: Provides scope boundaries for file operations
- **[../core-authority/workflow.md](../core-authority/workflow.md)**: Supplies validation requirements for file changes
- **[forbidden.md](forbidden.md)**: Defines restrictions on file creation patterns
