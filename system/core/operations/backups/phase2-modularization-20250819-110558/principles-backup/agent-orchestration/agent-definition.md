# AGENT DEFINITION

⏺ **Principle**: All agents must have excellently and precisely defined expert scopes to ensure maximum effectiveness and specialization.

- [Specialization Boundaries](#specialization-boundaries)
- [Capability Documentation](#capability-documentation)
- [Quality Assurance](#quality-assurance)
- [Principle References](#principle-references)
- [Cross-References](#cross-references)

## Expert Scope Requirements

⏺ **Principle**: Expert scope definition implements [engineering.md modular design](../quality-assurance/engineering.md) by creating highly specialized agents with clearly defined capabilities.

### Core Requirements
- **Domain expertise depth** - Deep knowledge in specific technical areas
- **Task specialization precision** - Exact alignment with task categories
- **Boundary clarity** - Clear definition of what agent does and does not handle
- **Performance optimization** - Maximum effectiveness within defined scope

### Scope Definition Elements
- **Primary function** - Core responsibility and expertise area
- **Technical capabilities** - Specific tools, languages, and methodologies
- **Quality standards** - Expected output excellence level
- **Integration points** - How agent connects with broader system

### Expertise Levels
- **Expert-level proficiency** - Deep understanding and advanced capabilities
- **Specialized knowledge** - Domain-specific insights and methodologies
- **Best practices mastery** - Industry standards and optimal approaches
- **Innovation capability** - Advanced problem-solving and creative solutions

## Precision Definition Standards

⏺ **Principle**: Precision standards implement [agent-selection.md quality standards](agent-selection.md#quality-standards) by ensuring agents meet exact specialization requirements.

### Definition Requirements
- **Unambiguous scope boundaries** - Clear inclusion and exclusion criteria
- **Measurable capabilities** - Quantifiable performance expectations
- **Specific tool proficiency** - Exact technical implementation abilities
- **Context-aware specialization** - Understanding of operational environment

### Documentation Standards
- **Capability catalog** - Complete listing of agent abilities
- **Limitation acknowledgment** - Clear statement of scope boundaries
- **Performance metrics** - Measurable effectiveness indicators
- **Integration protocols** - Standardized interaction methods

### Validation Criteria
- **Scope-task alignment** - Exact match between capabilities and requirements
- **Performance consistency** - Reliable output quality across deployments
- **Boundary adherence** - Strict operation within defined limits
- **Expert-level execution** - Superior performance in specialization area

## Specialization Boundaries

⏺ **Principle**: Specialization boundaries implement [context-efficiency.md delegation framework](context-efficiency.md#agent-delegation-framework) by preventing scope overlap and ensuring optimal task distribution.

### Boundary Definition Rules
- **Single responsibility focus** - One primary area of expertise per agent
- **Clear exclusion criteria** - Explicit definition of what agent does not handle
- **Scope overlap prevention** - Unique specialization without capability duplication
- **Integration interface definition** - How agent connects with other system components

### Scope Management
- **Expertise depth over breadth** - Deep specialization rather than general capability
- **Precise capability matching** - Exact alignment with specific task requirements
- **Resource optimization** - Efficient use of specialized knowledge
- **Quality maximization** - Superior performance through focused expertise

### Boundary Enforcement
- **Scope violation prevention** - Clear guidelines preventing capability creep
- **Task routing accuracy** - Correct agent selection for specific requirements
- **Performance optimization** - Maximum efficiency through specialization
- **Quality assurance** - Expert-level output through focused capability

### Orchestrator Role Restrictions

⏺ **Principle**: No agent, under any circumstances, can function as an orchestrator within the Claude Code Framework.

#### Orchestrator Prohibition Rules
- **Absolute Restriction** - Agents are categorically prohibited from orchestrator roles
- **Role Separation** - Clear separation between agent execution and orchestrator coordination
- **Framework Enforcement** - Orchestrator functions reserved exclusively for main Claude Code instance
- **Violation Prevention** - Any attempt to assume orchestrator role represents framework violation

#### Orchestrator-Exclusive Functions
- **Task Tool Coordination** - Only orchestrators deploy agents via Task tools
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Only orchestrators manage agent deployment strategies
- **Workflow Phase Management** - Only orchestrators control 10-phase methodology execution
- **User Communication** - Only orchestrators maintain direct user interaction

#### Agent Role Limitations
- **Execution Focus** - Agents execute tasks within their specialized domain using direct tools
- **Deployment Restriction** - Agents cannot deploy other agents via Task tools
- **Coordination Prohibition** - Agents cannot coordinate multi-agent workflows
- **Framework Boundary** - Agents operate exclusively within assigned specialization scope

## Capability Documentation

⏺ **Principle**: Capability documentation implements [../core-authority/workflow.md systematic phases](../core-authority/workflow.md) by providing complete agent specification for effective deployment.

### Documentation Requirements

#### Technical Specifications
- **Primary tools and technologies** - Exact implementation capabilities
- **Programming languages** - Specific language proficiencies
- **Framework expertise** - Detailed framework knowledge
- **Integration capabilities** - System connection and data exchange abilities

#### Functional Specifications
- **Task categories** - Specific types of work agent can perform
- **Output formats** - Types of deliverables agent produces
- **Quality standards** - Expected excellence levels and validation criteria
- **Performance metrics** - Measurable effectiveness indicators

#### Operational Specifications
- **Deployment context** - When and how to use agent
- **Success criteria** - How to measure agent effectiveness
- **Limitation boundaries** - What agent cannot do and operational constraints
- **Integration protocols** - How agent works within broader system

## Quality Assurance

⏺ **Principle**: Quality assurance implements [../core-authority/workflow.md validation phase](../core-authority/workflow.md#7-validation) by ensuring all agents meet expert specialization standards.

### Agent Validation Standards
- **Expertise verification** - Confirmation of deep domain knowledge
- **Capability testing** - Validation of claimed functionalities
- **Performance benchmarking** - Measurement against expert-level standards
- **Integration testing** - Verification of system compatibility

### Continuous Improvement
- **Performance monitoring** - Ongoing assessment of agent effectiveness
- **Scope refinement** - Continuous optimization of capability boundaries
- **Knowledge updating** - Regular enhancement of domain expertise
- **Framework compliance** - Ongoing adherence to system principles

### Quality Metrics
- **Task completion accuracy** - Percentage of successful task fulfillment
- **Output quality consistency** - Reliable excellence across deployments
- **Expert-level performance** - Comparison against domain expertise standards
- **User satisfaction** - Effectiveness in meeting user requirements
