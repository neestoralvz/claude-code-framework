## Mandatory Agent Usage

⏺ **Principle**: This mandate implements [../core-authority/directive.md execution requirements](../core-authority/directive.md) by ensuring ALL tasks execute through specialized agents from /agents/ folder exclusively.

### Core Requirements
- **NO DIRECT EXECUTION** - Main instance MUST NOT perform tasks directly when agents exist
- **AGENT-FIRST APPROACH** - Always check /agents/ folder before any task execution
- **MANDATORY DELEGATION** - Use Task Tool to deploy appropriate agents for all operations
- **ZERO EXCEPTIONS** - No task exemptions from agent delegation requirement

### Enforcement Protocol
1. **Task receipt** - Analyze incoming request for agent requirements
2. **Agent catalog scan** - Search /agents/ folder for suitable specialist
3. **Deployment decision** - Either deploy existing agent or generate creation ticket
4. **Execution restriction** - NEVER proceed with direct execution when agents available

### Quality Benefits
- **Specialized expertise** - Agents provide deeper domain knowledge
- **Consistent quality** - Standardized approach across all task types
- **Context preservation** - Main instance maintains high-level coordination
- **Framework integrity** - Systematic adherence to delegation principles

## Selection Methodology

⏺ **Principle**: This methodology implements [context-efficiency.md delegation framework](context-efficiency.md#agent-delegation-framework) through systematic agent matching analysis.

### Core Process
1. **Analyze task requirements** from multiple perspectives
2. **Evaluate existing agent catalog** for capability matches
3. **Assess agent scope alignment** with task specifics
4. **Determine creation necessity** if no optimal match exists
5. **Deploy selected or created agent** via Task Tool

### Decision Framework
- **Task complexity analysis** - Determine specialization requirements
- **Scope precision matching** - Align agent expertise with task needs
- **Performance optimization** - Select most effective agent for outcome
- **Resource efficiency** - Balance capability with task requirements

## Agent Catalog Assessment

⏺ **Principle**: Catalog assessment implements [engineering.md modular design](../quality-assurance/engineering.md) by evaluating existing agents against task requirements.

### Current Agent Catalog
- **project-optimizer** - Complex analysis and optimization tasks
- **agent-creator** - Building specialized tools and new agents
- **delegation-advisor** - Task routing and distribution planning
- **agent-architect** - Gold standard agent structure and design
- **monitoring-specialist** - Real-time operational monitoring and alerting
- **system-auditor** - Static analysis and compliance validation
- **validation-engineer** - Quality methodology and evidence-based verification

**For complete agent capabilities and selection guidance, refer to [architecture/agent-capability-matrix.md](../architecture/agent-orchestration/agent-capability-matrix.md)**

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Scope alignment** - Direct match between agent expertise and task needs
- **Capability coverage** - Complete task fulfillment potential
- **Quality track record** - Historical performance and reliability
- **Resource efficiency** - Optimal capability-to-task ratio

### Selection Rules
- **Highest specialization priority** - ALWAYS select agent with deepest domain expertise (doctorate-level knowledge)
- **Exact match priority** - Select agent with precise scope alignment over generalist approaches
- **Capability superset** - Choose agent whose capabilities encompass task requirements completely
- **Avoid scope overlap** - Prevent using general-purpose when specialist exists
- **Never force fit** - Create new agent rather than misalign existing one
- **Expertise hierarchy** - Prefer specialist > expert > generalist for optimal task fulfillment

## Agent Creation Decision

⏺ **Principle**: Creation decisions implement [context-efficiency.md quality control](context-efficiency.md#quality-control) by ensuring optimal agent availability for all task types.

### Creation Triggers
- **No suitable agent exists** in current catalog
- **Scope mismatch** - Available agents lack required specialization
- **Quality requirements** - Existing agents insufficient for task complexity
- **Future reusability** - Task type likely to recur frequently

### Creation Process
1. **Deploy agent-creator** for new agent development
2. **Define precise agent scope** per expert specialization requirements
3. **Validate agent effectiveness** through test deployment
4. **Integrate into catalog** for future reference

### Quality Standards
- **Expert-level specialization** - Deep capability in target domain
- **Precise scope definition** - Clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Framework compliance** - Adherence to all system principles
- **Documented capabilities** - Clear usage guidelines and limitations

## Ticket Generation Requirements

⏺ **Principle**: This requirement implements [TICKET_METHODOLOGY.md systematic tracking](../../planning/TICKET_METHODOLOGY.md) by ensuring ALL missing agent scenarios generate continuation tickets before conversation termination.

### Mandatory Ticket Scenarios

#### Missing Agent Discovery
- **IMMEDIATE TICKET GENERATION** when no suitable agent exists in /agents/ folder
- **CONVERSATION TERMINATION** after ticket creation to prevent direct execution
- **CLEAR TRACKING** of required agent specifications and timeline
- **PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION** based on task urgency and system impact

#### Planning Phase Agent Identification
- **PROACTIVE TICKET CREATION** during planning when multiple agents needed
- **FUTURE AGENT REQUIREMENTS** documented for systematic development
- **WORKFLOW CONTINUITY** ensured through ticket-based agent creation tracking
- **RESOURCE ALLOCATION** planning for agent development priorities

### Ticket Generation Protocol

#### Required Ticket Content
1. **Agent specification** - Precise scope and capability requirements
2. **Task context** - Original request and execution requirements
3. **Priority level** - Urgency classification for development scheduling
4. **Dependencies** - Related agents or framework components needed
5. **Success criteria** - Validation requirements for completed agent

#### Ticket Integration Process
1. **Generate ticket** using [TICKET_REGISTRY.md methodology](../../planning/TICKET_REGISTRY.md)
2. **Classify priority** based on framework impact and user urgency
3. **Document context** with sufficient detail for future agent creation
4. **Terminate conversation** with clear user notification of ticket creation
5. **Schedule follow-up** for agent creation and task completion

### Quality Assurance
- **NO WORKAROUNDS** - Never proceed without appropriate agent
- **COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION** - All ticket content requirements fulfilled
- **SYSTEMATIC TRACKING** - Integration with existing ticket management
- **USER TRANSPARENCY** - Clear communication of process and timeline
