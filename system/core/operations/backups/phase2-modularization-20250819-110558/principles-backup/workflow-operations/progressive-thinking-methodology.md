## Quality Assurance and Validation

### Thinking Level Appropriateness
- **Under-thinking Detection**: Insufficient analysis depth for task complexity
- **Over-thinking Prevention**: Excessive analysis for simple tasks
- **Progressive Consistency**: Logical progression through thinking levels
- **Evidence Validation**: Sufficient evidence supporting thinking level claims

### Integration with Validation Framework
- **[Validation Principles](validation.md)** → Quality assurance methodology
- **[10-Phase Methodology](10-phase-detailed-methodology.md)** → Phase-specific application
- **[Task Tool Syntax](task-tool-syntax.md)** → Orchestration integration
