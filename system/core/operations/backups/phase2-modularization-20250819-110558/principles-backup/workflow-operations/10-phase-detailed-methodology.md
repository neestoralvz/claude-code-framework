# 10-PHASE DETAILED METHODOLOGY GUIDE

## Purpose

⏺ **Execution Guide**: Comprehensive detailed guidance for systematic execution of the complete 10-phase workflow methodology with progressive thinking integration and current research capabilities.


## PHASE 2: EXPLORATION (MANDATORY)
**DISCOVER and gather comprehensive contextual information - CANNOT BE SKIPPED**

### Progressive Thinking Application
**MANDATORY**: Think (basic search) → Think Hard (deep patterns) → Think Harder (systemic connections) → UltraThink (architectural implications)

### Execution Steps
- **SEARCH** relevant files and patterns with systematic depth analysis
- **READ** necessary content applying appropriate thinking complexity
- **MAP** dependencies and relationships through progressive analysis levels
- **Git Operations**: `git log --oneline -10`, `git diff HEAD~1`, examine repository context

### Completion Criteria
**COMPLETE WHEN**: Context mapped, information gathered, dependencies identified, progressive exploration completed


## PHASE 4: ANALYSIS (MANDATORY)
**EXAMINE and understand findings to generate actionable solutions - REQUIRED COMPLETION**

### Progressive Thinking Application
**MANDATORY**: Think (basic analysis) → Think Hard (pattern recognition) → Think Harder (systemic evaluation) → UltraThink (strategic implications)

### Execution Steps
- **EXAMINE** discovered information using systematic thinking depth
- **SYNTHESIZE** local findings with research through progressive complexity levels
- **IDENTIFY** patterns, issues, and best practices with appropriate analytical depth
- **DOCUMENT** key findings with modern context and progressive thinking evidence
- **Git Operations**: `git diff --cached`, `git log --graph --oneline`, assess change impact

### Completion Criteria
**COMPLETE WHEN**: Patterns found, solutions generated, feasibility assessed, progressive analysis completed


## PHASE 6: PLANNING (MANDATORY)
**DESIGN atomic, hierarchical implementation WITH MANDATORY PRINCIPLE VALIDATION - CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT VALIDATION**

### Progressive Thinking Application
**MANDATORY**: Think (basic planning) → Think Hard (complexity analysis) → Think Harder (integration challenges) → UltraThink (long-term architecture)

### Execution Steps
- **DESIGN** integral solutions targeting root problems using systematic thinking depth
- **CREATE** comprehensive strategies through progressive complexity assessment
- **STRUCTURE** atomic task breakdown with specialized agent assignment
- **ESTABLISH** operations/{conversation-id}/ storage structure for agent outputs
- **DEFINE** quantifiable success criteria with mathematical validation metrics
- **CREATE** objective measurement frameworks using calculable evidence
- **SPECIFY** success thresholds with numerical benchmarks and validation scripts

### Mandatory Principle Validation
**REFERENCE**: [Principle Validation Checkpoints](principle-validation-checkpoints.md) for complete validation procedures

### Git Operations
`git checkout -b feature/task-description`, `git push -u origin feature/task-description`

### Completion Criteria
**COMPLETE WHEN**: Tasks defined, agents assigned, dependencies mapped, **PRINCIPLES VALIDATED**
**VALIDATION GATE**: **PLAN MUST PASS SIMPLICITY AND PRINCIPLE VALIDATION BEFORE PROCEEDING**


## PHASE 8: RIPPLE EFFECT (MANDATORY)
**MANAGE implementation consequences and dependencies - OBLIGATORY IMPACT MANAGEMENT**

### Progressive Thinking Application
**MANDATORY**: Think (direct impacts) → Think Hard (cascading effects) → Think Harder (system-wide implications) → UltraThink (ecosystem evolution)

### Execution Steps
- **HANDLE** cross-references using systematic thinking depth
- **UPDATE** dependent elements through progressive impact assessment
- **MAINTAIN** system integrity with appropriate complexity analysis
- **Git Operations**: `git fetch origin`, `git rebase origin/main`, `git push --force-with-lease`

### Completion Criteria
**COMPLETE WHEN**: Dependencies updated, system stable, documentation synced, progressive impact thinking applied


## PHASE 10: CLOSURE (MANDATORY)
**IDENTIFY patterns, clean system, commit changes, and push to GitHub - FINAL OBLIGATORY COMPLETION**

### Progressive Thinking Application
**MANDATORY**: Think (basic cleanup) → Think Hard (pattern identification) → Think Harder (system optimization) → UltraThink (framework evolution insights)

### Execution Steps
- **IDENTIFY PATTERNS**: Analyze implemented solution for reusable patterns, anti-patterns, and optimization opportunities
- **DOCUMENT INSIGHTS**: Record lessons learned, emerging patterns, and framework improvements in operations/{conversation-id}/closure-analysis/
- **CLEAN SYSTEM**: Remove temporary files, optimize file structure, consolidate documentation
- **VALIDATE FINAL STATE**: Confirm all tests pass, build succeeds, lint checks complete
- **COMMIT CHANGES**: Create comprehensive commit with clear description of work completed
- **PUSH TO GITHUB**: Execute `git push` to remote repository with all changes
- **GENERATE CLOSURE REPORT**: Create summary of work completed, patterns identified, and recommendations

### Mandatory Closure Tasks
**REFERENCE**: [Workflow Support Operations](workflow-support-operations.md) for closure task details

### Git Operations
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "feat: [description] - pattern analysis and system optimization"`
- `git push origin [branch-name]`

### Completion Criteria
**COMPLETE WHEN**: Patterns documented, system cleaned, changes committed and pushed, closure report generated
