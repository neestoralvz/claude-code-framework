# CORE AUTHORITY DOMAIN

## 🎯 Domain Purpose
Establishes fundamental system authority and execution patterns that govern the entire framework.

## 📋 Files in This Domain (Authority Level Order)
1. **[directive.md](directive.md)** - Level 0: Ultimate system authority (no dependencies)
2. **[workflow.md](workflow.md)** - Level 1: Primary execution framework (15 dependents)
3. **[fundamental.md](fundamental.md)** - Level 2: Philosophical foundation (5 dependents)

## 🔄 Authority Chain Flow
```
directive.md (Ultimate) → workflow.md (Primary) → fundamental.md (Foundation) → All Specialized Domains
```

## 🚨 Change Impact Warnings
- **directive.md**: System-wide authority changes - requires framework-level review
- **workflow.md**: CRITICAL - 15 dependent files across all domains affected by changes
- **fundamental.md**: Philosophical changes affect domain principles consistency

## 🚀 Common Usage Patterns
- **Authority Resolution**: Start with directive.md for ultimate guidance
- **Workflow Implementation**: Reference workflow.md for execution patterns
- **Philosophical Guidance**: Consult fundamental.md for foundational principles
