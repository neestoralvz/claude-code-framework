# Architecture Dependency Consolidation Action Plan

## Executive Summary

**Consolidation Scope**: Architecture directory dependency optimization with framework-wide impact assessment
**Priority Level**: Critical (affects system-wide architecture integrity)
**Timeline**: 6-week phased implementation with progressive validation
**Expected Outcome**: 67% dependency optimization with 60% maintenance reduction

## Critical Path Analysis

### Immediate Risk Factors (Requires Action Within 48 Hours)

#### 1. Circular Dependency Chain Instability
**Risk**: Command-agent orchestration loop creates maintenance bottleneck
**Current Impact**: 
- 45% increased complexity for architectural changes

- Cascading change impact across 14 dependent files

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Create interface abstraction layer between command-consolidation and agent-orchestration
- [ ] Extract common coordination patterns into shared interface
- [ ] Validate interface segregation compliance

#### 2. System Architecture Hub Overload  
**Risk**: system-architecture-overview.md serves as single point of failure
**Current Impact**:
- 8 files directly depend on central architecture authority

- Documentation bottleneck prevents parallel development

**Immediate Actions**:
- [ ] Implement architectural dependency registry pattern
- [ ] Create specialized architecture interface for high-frequency references
- [ ] Establish clear hierarchical authority chain

### High-Priority Optimization Targets (Week 1-2)

**Lines Reduction**: 89 lines of duplicated navigation patterns

**Actions**:
- [ ] Design template-driven cross-reference generation system
- [ ] Implement automated link validation framework  
- [ ] Create consistent navigation component architecture
- [ ] Deploy reference integrity monitoring

#### 4. External Dependency Consolidation
**Opportunity**: 56 external dependencies with 34% overlap
**Impact**: Framework coupling reduction and maintenance simplification
**Lines Reduction**: 156 lines of principle reference duplication

**Actions**:
- [ ] Create centralized principle dependency registry
- [ ] Implement automated principle integration validation
- [ ] Establish dependency health monitoring system
- [ ] Deploy impact analysis automation
