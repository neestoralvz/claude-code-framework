### 3. Consolidation Action Plan
**File**: [consolidation-impact-action-plan.md](consolidation-impact-action-plan.md)
**Content**: Detailed 6-week phased implementation plan with risk mitigation
**Implementation Strategy**:
- Phase 1: Critical infrastructure stabilization (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Reference standardization (Week 2) 
- Phase 3: Advanced integration (Week 3-4)
- Phase 4: Advanced optimization (Week 5-6)

## Critical Findings Summary

### High-Priority Issues
- **7 circular dependency chains** requiring immediate architectural refactoring
- **system-architecture-overview.md** serving as single point of failure (9.8/10 risk)
- **command-consolidation-architecture.md** creating maintenance bottleneck (8.7/10 risk)
- **agent-orchestration-framework.md** involved in 3 circular dependencies (8.4/10 risk)

### Consolidation Opportunities
- **556 lines** of dependency duplication can be eliminated
- **47 cross-references** can be unified through template-driven generation
- **23 principle references** can be centralized through dependency registry
- **60% maintenance reduction** achievable through automation

### Strategic Benefits
- Clear hierarchical dependency structure establishment
- Automated dependency validation and integrity checking
- Proactive dependency health monitoring implementation  
- 95% architecture consistency improvement potential
