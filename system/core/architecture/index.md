## ✅ ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

### 🎯 DESIGN STANDARDS
- [x] **SOLID Compliance** - Single responsibility, open/closed, interface segregation
- [x] **Modular Design** - Clear separation of concerns and boundaries
- [x] **Command-Centered** - All operations flow through command architecture
- [x] **Agent-First** - Specialized agent deployment for all tasks

### 🔄 INTEGRATION PATTERNS
- **Framework Integration** → All architecture components integrate with core framework
- **Command Integration** → Command-centered execution for all architectural patterns
- **Agent Integration** → Agent-first deployment throughout architecture
- **Validation Integration** → Built-in quality gates and validation protocols
