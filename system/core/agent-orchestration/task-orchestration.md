# TASK ORCHESTRATION

⏺ **Principle**: The main Claude Code instance orchestrates all complex tasks through strategic Task Tool deployment while maintaining continuous user context and workflow control.

## Orchestration Methodology

⏺ **Principle**: This methodology implements [context-efficiency.md preservation strategy](context-efficiency.md#context-preservation-strategy) by maintaining main instance continuity while delegating specialized execution.

### Core Orchestration Rules
- **Main instance retains user communication** - Never delegate direct user interaction
- **Deploy Task Tool for all complex operations** - Preserve main instance context
- **Coordinate multiple agent deployments** - Manage parallel and sequential task execution
- **Validate all agent outputs** - Ensure quality before user presentation

### Strategic Control Points
- **Task intake and analysis** - Main instance evaluates user requirements
- **Agent selection and deployment** - Strategic choice of specialized tools
- **Output integration and validation** - Quality assurance and coherent presentation
- **Workflow progression** - Phase management and completion tracking

## Task Analysis Framework

**Execute systematic task decomposition and classification:**
- Analyze request complexity using progressive thinking methodology (Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → UltraThink)
- Decompose complex tasks into atomic, manageable components following hierarchical breakdown principles
- Classify tasks by domain expertise requirements enabling optimal agent selection and deployment
- Evaluate resource requirements and timeline constraints for strategic planning and execution
- Identify task dependencies and relationships supporting parallel execution optimization

**Task Complexity Assessment:**
- Apply progressive thinking complexity criteria based on estimated execution time and cognitive requirements
- Map task requirements to available agent capabilities using systematic capability assessment
- Determine optimal execution patterns (sequential, parallel, or hybrid) based on dependency analysis
- Evaluate risk factors and mitigation strategies for complex task coordination scenarios

## Agent Coordination Strategies

**Execute intelligent agent coordination patterns:**
- Deploy multiple agents in parallel for independent task execution when dependencies allow
- Coordinate sequential agent deployment following logical dependency chains and prerequisite completion
- Implement wave-based deployment patterns for complex multi-phase operations requiring staged execution
- Apply specialized agent selection based on domain expertise and task complexity requirements
- Monitor agent execution progress and coordinate resource allocation across multiple concurrent operations

**Multi-Agent Deployment Patterns:**
- Execute independent operations using parallel agent deployment for maximum efficiency
- Coordinate multi-perspective analysis through specialized agent deployment across different domains
- Manage resource conflicts and coordination points through systematic agent communication protocols
- Apply agent result integration patterns ensuring coherent output compilation and quality assurance

## Communication and Quality Protocols

**Execute systematic orchestration quality oversight:**
- Maintain continuous user context preservation throughout multi-agent task execution cycles
- Validate all agent outputs against quality standards before integration and user presentation
- Coordinate consistent communication patterns ensuring coherent user experience across agent interactions
- Apply systematic progress tracking and status reporting for complex multi-agent operations
- Implement error handling and recovery protocols for agent coordination failures or conflicts

**Quality Assurance Integration:**
- Execute comprehensive validation of agent deliverables before compilation and user delivery
- Apply consistency checking across multiple agent outputs ensuring coherent final results
- Coordinate stakeholder communication maintaining clear expectations and progress visibility
- Implement rollback and recovery procedures for failed or incomplete agent execution scenarios
