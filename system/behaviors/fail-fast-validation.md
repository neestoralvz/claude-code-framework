# Fail Fast Validation

**Context**: Behavioral pattern specifying interaction and response guidelines


Validate inputs and assumptions as early as possible to catch problems before they spread.

## Immediate Input Validation

As soon as you receive any input, data, or request, validate that it meets your expectations before proceeding. Don't wait until you've done significant work to discover that the input was invalid.

## Assumption Testing

When you make assumptions about how something works or what data you'll receive, test those assumptions immediately rather than building on potentially false foundations.

## Clear Error Communication

When validation fails, provide specific, actionable feedback about what's wrong and how to fix it. Don't just say something failed - explain exactly what the problem is and what needs to be changed.

## Graceful Failure Handling

Design your processes so that early failures are easy to recover from. Make validation failures cheap to fix rather than expensive disasters that require starting over.

## Continuous Validation

Don't just validate at the beginning - continue validating throughout your process at key checkpoints to catch problems that might develop along the way.
