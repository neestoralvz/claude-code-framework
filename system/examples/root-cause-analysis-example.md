# Root Cause Analysis Example

**Context**: Complete demonstration of root cause analysis techniques for different complexity levels

**Purpose**: Show practical application of 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, and systematic investigation methods

---

## Example Scenario: E-commerce Website Performance Issues

**Problem Statement**: "Customer complaints about slow website loading times have increased 300% over the past month, leading to a 15% decrease in conversion rates and estimated revenue loss of $50,000 weekly."

## Example 1: Simple Issue - 5 Whys Analysis

**Scenario**: Initial investigation reveals specific page loading slowly

### 5 Whys Process

**Problem**: Product search page takes 8+ seconds to load

**Why 1**: Why is the product search page loading slowly?
- **Answer**: Database queries are taking 6+ seconds to execute

**Why 2**: Why are database queries taking so long?
- **Answer**: The product search query isn't using database indexes

**Why 3**: Why isn't the search query using indexes?
- **Answer**: The recent feature update changed the query structure without updating indexes

**Why 4**: Why wasn't the index updated with the feature change?
- **Answer**: Database index review isn't part of our feature deployment process

**Why 5**: Why isn't database review included in deployment?
- **Answer**: No established performance review checklist for feature deployments

**Root Cause Identified**: Missing performance review checklist in deployment process

### Solution Implementation

**Immediate Fix**:
- Add missing database index for product search
- Estimated implementation: 2 hours
- Expected result: Query time reduction from 6s to <0.5s

**Root Cause Solution**:
- Create performance review checklist for all feature deployments
- Include database impact assessment
- Add automated performance testing to CI/CD pipeline
- Estimated implementation: 1 week
- Expected result: Prevent similar issues in future deployments

### Validation Results

**Immediate Fix Results**:
- Product search query time: 6.2s ‚Üí 0.3s (95% improvement)
- Page load time: 8.1s ‚Üí 2.1s (74% improvement)
- Customer complaints reduced by 80% within 48 hours

**Root Cause Solution Results**:
- Performance review checklist implemented
- Automated performance testing deployed
- Zero performance regressions in subsequent 10 feature deployments
- Proactive identification of 3 potential performance issues

## Example 2: Moderate Complexity - Fishbone Diagram Analysis

**Scenario**: Multiple factors contributing to overall website performance issues

### Fishbone Categories Analysis

#### People Factors
- **Development Team**: Lack of performance optimization training
- **QA Team**: Performance testing not included in test plans
- **Operations Team**: Insufficient monitoring and alerting setup
- **Management**: Performance requirements not clearly defined

#### Process Factors
- **Development Process**: No performance requirements in user stories
- **Testing Process**: Load testing only done before major releases
- **Deployment Process**: No performance regression testing
- **Monitoring Process**: Reactive rather than proactive monitoring

#### Technology (Machines) Factors
- **Database**: Old version with known performance issues
- **Web Server**: Default configuration not optimized for traffic volume
- **CDN**: Content delivery network not properly configured
- **Cache**: Application-level caching not implemented

#### Materials (Resources) Factors
- **Documentation**: No performance benchmarks documented
- **Tools**: Insufficient performance monitoring tools
- **Infrastructure**: Database server undersized for current load
- **Knowledge**: Team lacks expertise in performance optimization

#### Environment Factors
- **Production Environment**: Different configuration from development
- **Network**: Increased latency during peak hours
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party API response times increased
- **User Behavior**: Traffic patterns changed due to recent marketing campaign

#### Measurement Factors
- **Metrics**: Limited performance metrics collection
- **Alerting**: No proactive alerts for performance degradation
- **Baseline**: No established performance baselines
- **Reporting**: Performance data not regularly reviewed

### Root Cause Prioritization

**High Impact, High Probability**:
1. Database server undersized for current load (Materials)
2. No performance regression testing (Process)
3. Application-level caching not implemented (Technology)

**High Impact, Medium Probability**:
4. QA team not including performance testing (People)
5. Traffic patterns changed due to marketing campaign (Environment)

**Medium Impact, High Probability**:
6. Web server configuration not optimized (Technology)
7. Insufficient performance monitoring tools (Materials)

### Comprehensive Solution Strategy
