# Parallel Task Processing Example

**Context**: Practical example demonstrating framework implementation patterns


Real example showing how to process multiple items efficiently using parallel execution.

## The Situation

We need to process a list of customer records, where each customer requires the same operations but the tasks are independent of each other.

## Implementation Pattern

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def process_customer(customer_id: str) -> str:
    # Simulate processing work
    result = f"Processed customer {customer_id}"
    return result

@flow
def process_customer_batch(customer_ids: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    # Map the processing task across all customer IDs in parallel
    results = process_customer.map(customer_ids)
    return results

# Usage
customer_list = ["customer1", "customer2", "customer3", "customer4"]
processed_results = process_customer_batch(customer_list)
```

## Results

All customer processing tasks run simultaneously instead of one after another. A batch that would take 40 seconds sequentially completes in 10 seconds with parallel execution.

## Key Benefits

Dramatically reduced processing time for independent tasks. Better resource utilization by running multiple operations concurrently. Simple pattern that scales automatically with the number of items.

## When to Apply

Use this pattern when you have multiple items that need the same processing and don't depend on each other's results.
