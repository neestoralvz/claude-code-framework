Workflows and procedures for getting work done.

## Primary Workflow
- **[Complete Workflow](processes/complete-workflow.md)** - Main process for handling all messages
  - Explore ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Maintain

## Thinking Processes  
- **[Think](processes/think.md)** - Basic thinking for straightforward tasks
- **[Think Hard](processes/think-hard.md)** - Deeper thinking for complex tasks
- **[Think Harder](processes/think-harder.md)** - Systematic analysis for complex problems
- **[Ultra Think](processes/ultra-think.md)** - Maximum depth analysis for fundamental changes
- **[Progressive Thinking](processes/progressive-thinking.md)** - Break complex tasks into manageable steps

## Decision Processes
- **[Automate or Manual](processes/automate-or-manual.md)** - Choose between manual work and automation

## Supporting Processes
- **[Structural Workflow](processes/structural-workflow.md)** - How we organize our system
- **[Exploration First Workflow](processes/exploration-first-workflow.md)** - Understanding before acting
- **[Project Structure Update Workflow](processes/project-structure-update-workflow.md)** - Keeping structure current
- **[Conditional Navigation Methodology](processes/conditional-navigation-methodology.md)** - Playbook-style decision trees for just-in-time context loading

## Research and Analysis Processes
- **[Research and Document](processes/research-and-document.md)** - Finding current information and preserving it
- **[Extended Thinking Workflow](processes/extended-thinking-workflow.md)** - Systematic approach for complex problems
- **[Strategic Problem-Solving Workflow](processes/strategic-problem-solving-workflow.md)** - Evidence-based strategic analysis and solution design
- **[Root Cause Analysis Workflow](processes/root-cause-analysis-workflow.md)** - Systematic investigation and elimination of underlying issues

## Execution Processes
- **[Error Handling Workflow](processes/error-handling-workflow.md)** - Systematic error handling and recovery
- **[Parallel Execution Workflow](processes/parallel-execution-workflow.md)** - Running multiple tasks efficiently

## Strategic Planning Processes
- **[Strategic Vision Definition Workflow](processes/strategic-vision-definition-workflow.md)** - Systematic process for defining project vision, mission, and objectives
- **[Success Criteria Framework Workflow](processes/success-criteria-framework-workflow.md)** - Methodology for establishing measurable success conditions
- **[Success Metrics System Workflow](processes/success-metrics-system-workflow.md)** - Quantitative measurement framework for progress tracking
- **[Strategic Planning Integration Workflow](processes/strategic-planning-integration-workflow.md)** - Coordination process for unified strategic planning execution

## Session Management Processes
- **[Session Conclusion Workflow](processes/session-conclusion-workflow.md)** - Systematic conversation closure with automated agent coordination

**Total: 25 Processes**
