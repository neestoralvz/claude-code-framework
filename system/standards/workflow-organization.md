# Workflow Organization

**Context**: Quality standard ensuring consistency and compliance requirements


Structure workflows for clarity, maintainability, and reusability.

## Flow Structure

Define flows with clear purpose and single responsibility. Use descriptive names that explain what the workflow accomplishes. Keep flows focused on orchestration rather than detailed implementation.

## Task Definition

Create tasks for reusable units of work that can be tested independently. Use clear parameter and return types for all tasks. Design tasks to be composable with other tasks in different workflows.

## Dependency Management

Make dependencies between tasks explicit through parameter passing rather than hidden through shared state. Use dependency injection patterns to make workflows testable with different implementations.

## Error Handling

Define error handling strategies at the workflow level for different types of failures. Use timeouts and retry policies appropriate for each task type. Provide clear error messages that help diagnose problems.

## Resource Management

Define resource requirements for workflows including compute, memory, and external service dependencies. Use concurrency limits to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.

## Monitoring Integration

Include monitoring and logging points throughout workflows to track progress and diagnose issues. Create artifacts and reports that provide visibility into workflow execution.
