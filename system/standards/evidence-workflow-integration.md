**IF integrating evidence with workflows** â†’ READ [evidence-patterns.md](evidence-patterns.md) for evidence standards, THEN follow these integration patterns for seamless TDD/BDD workflow incorporation


# Evidence Workflow Integration Patterns

**Context**: Comprehensive integration patterns for embedding evidence collection and validation into existing TDD/BDD workflows

---

These integration patterns ensure evidence collection becomes a natural, automated part of existing workflows without disrupting development velocity or adding excessive overhead.

## Core Integration Principles

### Seamless Integration Requirements
- **Zero Workflow Disruption**: Evidence collection integrates without changing core workflow steps
- **Automated Collection**: 80% of evidence collection happens automatically
- **Just-in-Time Validation**: Evidence validation occurs at natural workflow checkpoints
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Evidence quality improves incrementally without blocking progress
- **Tool Integration**: Evidence systems integrate with existing development tools

### Integration Quality Standards
- **Workflow Compatibility**: 100% compatibility with existing TDD/BDD processes
- **Performance Impact**: < 5% overhead added to workflow execution time
- **User Experience**: Evidence collection feels natural and helpful, not burdensome
- **Data Quality**: Integrated evidence meets same quality standards as standalone collection

## TDD/BDD Unified Workflow Integration

### BDD Scenario for Evidence Integration
```gherkin
Feature: Evidence Collection Workflow Integration
  As a developer following TDD/BDD workflows
  I want evidence collection to integrate seamlessly
  So that I can maintain development velocity while ensuring quality validation

Scenario: Integrated Evidence Collection During TDD Cycle
  Given I am following the TDD/BDD unified workflow
  When I complete each phase of the TDD cycle
  Then evidence should be collected automatically where possible
  And manual evidence collection should be guided and efficient
  And evidence validation should occur at natural checkpoints
  And workflow progression should not be blocked by evidence collection
  But quality gates should still enforce evidence requirements
```
