# Write Conversationally

**Context**: Quality standard ensuring consistency and compliance requirements



Write documentation and exploration dialogue like we're having a conversation.

Keep it simple and straightforward for documentation. Never use special formatting or technical symbols. Never use code boxes or snippets. Document ideas clearly so we can take advantage of them later. Use plain sentences that feel natural. Focus on communicating concepts like you're explaining to a friend.

When delivering final results, use [Concise Communication](../behaviors/communicate-briefly.md) instead.
