# Clean Content

**Context**: Quality standard ensuring consistency and compliance requirements


**[System](../INDEX.md) › [Standards](../STANDARDS.md) › Clean Content**

Keep file content focused on the actual information, not navigation.

- Remove manual breadcrumb navigation from files
- Avoid duplicate navigation maintenance
- Let structure handle navigation automatically
- Focus files on their core purpose and content
- Keep information in single authoritative locations
- Use index files for navigation rather than embedding it everywhere
