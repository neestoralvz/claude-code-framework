# File Organization

**Context**: Quality standard ensuring consistency and compliance requirements


**[System](../INDEX.md) › [Standards](../STANDARDS.md) › File Organization**

Consistent ways to organize and structure files.

- Create logical folder hierarchies without unnecessary nesting
- Group related files together by purpose
- Use clear folder names that describe contents
- Keep main entry points at appropriate levels
- Avoid deep folder structures when flat ones work better
- Place navigation and index files where users expect them
