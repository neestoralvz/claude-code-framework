# Type Safe Interfaces

**Context**: Quality standard ensuring consistency and compliance requirements


Use type annotations and validation to ensure data correctness at interface boundaries.

## Interface Definition

Always define clear types for function parameters, return values, and data structures. Use specific types like `list[str]` instead of generic types like `list`. Include validation rules for constraints like minimum values or string patterns.

## Validation Implementation

Implement validation at every interface boundary where data enters or leaves your system. Use structured validation that provides specific error messages about what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Error Communication

Return structured error information that includes the field name, the problematic value, the expected format, and suggested corrections. Use consistent error codes that tools can process automatically.

## Runtime Checking

Validate data at runtime, not just at development time. Type hints alone don't prevent runtime errors, so combine them with validation frameworks that check actual values.

## Interface Documentation

Document not just what types are expected, but what the valid ranges, formats, and constraints are. Include examples of valid and invalid inputs with explanations.
