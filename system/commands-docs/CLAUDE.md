## Development Workflow

### Dynamic Composite Workflow Adaptation

**MANDATORY ADAPTATION RULE**: All actions must dynamically adapt to the composite workflow template unless a specific command is explicitly defined and executed.

When no specific command is provided, follow the systematic 10-phase methodology defined in the composite workflow template:

**1. Execute This Composite Workflow** â†’ Define complex multi-phase goals requiring specialized agents
**2. Execute Comprehensive Multi-System Exploration** â†’ Deploy exploration agents across system domains
**3. Read Required Documentation** â†’ Review essential documents before execution
**4. Define Success Criteria** â†’ Establish measurable success metrics and validation criteria
**5. Execute Planning** â†’ Apply Universal Planning Workflow for systematic solution design
**6. Execute Composite Multi-Agent Orchestration** â†’ Apply Universal Execution Workflow with multi-agent coordination
**7. Verify Success** â†’ Apply Universal Validation Workflow with four-gate validation methodology
**8. Execute Recursion Until 100% Success** â†’ Apply Universal Recursion Workflow for continuous improvement
**9. Execute Ripple Effect Management** â†’ Apply Universal Ripple Effect Workflow for cross-system coordination
**10. Present Connected Workflows** â†’ Define prerequisite, parallel, follow-up, and alternative workflows

### Command Override Protocol

**EXCEPTION HANDLING**: When a specific command is explicitly defined and available:
1. Execute the defined command according to its specifications
2. Integrate command execution within the composite workflow framework
3. Apply universal workflow modules as applicable to command execution
4. Maintain composite workflow quality standards and validation requirements

### Workflow Template Integration

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOUNDATION**: All actions must integrate with the composite workflow template:
`.claude/workflows/templates/wf-create-workflow.md`

This template provides:
- **Universal Workflows Integration**: Comprehensive systematic command execution
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Parallel and sequential agent deployment patterns
- **Success Metrics Framework**: Measurable criteria with mathematical validation
- **Cross-System Integration**: Comprehensive ripple effect management
- **Continuous Improvement**: Recursive optimization until 100% success

### Universal Workflow Modules

The workflow system integrates universal modules:
- **Universal Planning Workflow**: Systematic planning methodology
- **Universal Execution Workflow**: Implementation with multi-agent coordination
- **Universal Validation Workflow**: Four-gate validation methodology
- **Universal Recursion Workflow**: Systematic iteration for continuous improvement
- **Universal Ripple Effect Workflow**: Cross-system coordination and dependency management

### Agent Orchestration Patterns

Follow these coordination patterns defined in the composite workflow:

**Phase 1: Foundation Agents** (Parallel Deployment)
- Deploy foundational capabilities simultaneously
- Establish system baseline and requirements

**Phase 2: Specialized Analysis Agents** (Parallel Deployment)
- Execute domain-specific analysis in parallel
- Gather comprehensive system intelligence

**Phase 3: Implementation Agents** (Sequential/Coordinated)
- Execute implementation based on analysis results
- Coordinate dependent implementation sequences

**Phase 4: Integration Agents** (Cross-System Coordination)
- Manage cross-system integration and validation
- Ensure comprehensive system coherence

### Success Criteria Framework

Apply mathematical validation with SUCCESS_METRICS:
```
efficiency: "[measurement] - Calculate as [formula]"
quality: "[measurement] - Calculate as [formula]" 
completeness: "[measurement] - Calculate as [formula]"
```

### Documentation Standards

All files maintain consistent patterns:
- Clear hierarchical organization by function
- Integration with universal workflow modules
- Navigation breadcrumbs for easy access
- Imperative command tone for workflows
- Template-driven consistency with composite workflow foundation
- Cross-reference integrity with universal workflow system
- Mathematical validation criteria for all deliverables

### Quality Assurance

Apply four-gate validation methodology:
1. **Requirements Gate**: Verify all specifications met completely
2. **Process Gate**: Confirm workflow compliance and execution quality
3. **Output Gate**: Validate deliverable quality and completeness
4. **System Gate**: Ensure no regressions and system integrity maintained

### Framework Integration

- **Authority Deference**: All operations follow main CLAUDE.md framework authority
- **Principle Compliance**: Apply principle system guidance consistently
- **Universal Workflow Integration**: Leverage systematic workflow modules
- **Agent Coordination**: Execute through Task tool orchestration patterns
- **Quality Standards**: Apply progressive thinking and mathematical validation
- **Cross-System Coherence**: Maintain framework-wide consistency and integration

## Important Notes

- **Universal Workflow Foundation**: All actions built on composite workflow template
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Systematic agent deployment with coordination patterns
- **Mathematical Validation**: Success criteria require quantifiable evidence
- **Cross-System Integration**: Comprehensive ripple effect management mandatory
- **Continuous Improvement**: Recursive optimization until 100% success achieved
- **Framework Coherence**: All operations maintain system-wide consistency

This documentation system provides structured navigation and reference support while implementing the comprehensive universal workflow methodology for systematic, multi-agent orchestrated execution with mathematical validation and cross-system integration.
