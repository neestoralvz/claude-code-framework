- Validating system health and compliance status


### 🔀 Cross-Functional Commands

Commands that serve both analysis and maintenance purposes, providing comprehensive solutions that examine current state and implement improvements.

#### 📊 Execution Management

Commands that analyze requirements and execute solutions:

- **[Execute Tickets](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md)** - Complete specific tickets through systematic 10-phase methodology (analyzes requirements, executes solutions)
- **[Parallel Plan Execution](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md)** - Coordinated multi-ticket execution through orchestrated workflow with monitoring

#### 📋 Project Management

Commands that analyze project needs and implement management solutions:

- **[Create Tickets](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md)** - Generate tickets through phase 1 (Clarification) and phase 10 (Closure) with standardized methodology
- **[Review Tickets](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md)** - Priority-based ticket analysis through phase 4 (Analysis) and execution coordination

#### 🎯 10-Phase Workflow Orchestration

The systematic workflow commands that progress from analysis to implementation:

**Analysis-Focused Phases (Understanding & Planning):**

- **[Phase 1: Clarification](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-1-clarification)** - Requirement analysis and success criteria establishment
- **[Phase 2: Exploration](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-2-exploration)** - Information gathering and context analysis
- **[Phase 3: Research](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-3-research)** - Modern research with WebSearch and Context7 integration
- **[Phase 4: Analysis](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-4-analysis)** - Solution analysis and option evaluation

- **[Phase 7: Implementation](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-7-implementation)** - Solution execution through specialized agent deployment
- **[Phase 8: Ripple Effect](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-8-ripple-effect)** - Consequence management and dependency resolution
- **[Phase 9: Validation](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-9-validation)** - Success verification and quality assurance

**Hybrid Support Phases (Problem Resolution & Iteration):**

- **[Phase 10: Closure](../../commands/compositions/workflows/10-phase-workflow.md#phase-10-closure)** - Pattern identification, system cleanup, and iterative improvement through recursive methodology

**Usage Guidelines for Cross-Functional Commands:**

- Use when you need both understanding and action
- Essential for complete problem-solving workflows
- Required for project management and coordination
- Ideal for comprehensive system improvements


## Usage Guidelines

### Command Selection Process

1. **Analyze task complexity** using the [Command Reference Matrix](../reference/mtx-reference-commands.md)
2. **Select optimal agents** with the [Agent Workflow Mapping](../reference/mtx-map-agents.md)
3. **Choose appropriate command** based on functional category and scope
4. **Execute with progressive thinking** (Think → Think Hard → Think Harder → UltraThink)

### Standard Execution Pattern

1. **Command Selection** - Match command to functional need (Analysis/Maintenance/Cross-Functional)
2. **Agent Deployment** - Use Task tools for orchestrator coordination
3. **Phase Execution** - Follow the 10-phase systematic methodology with integrated research
4. **Validation** - Verify success criteria and completeness with mathematical validation
5. **Documentation** - Update registries and maintain system documentation

### Common Command Parameters

- `--scope [minimal|comprehensive]` - Control analysis depth and breadth
- `--output [summary|detailed|json]` - Specify result format and structure
- `--priority [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]` - Set execution importance level
- `--category [type]` - Organize by functional classification

### Functional Category Selection Guide

- **Choose Analysis Commands** when you need to understand, examine, or investigate system state
- **Choose System Maintenance Commands** when you need to modify, optimize, or improve system functionality
- **Choose Cross-Functional Commands** when you need both analysis and implementation in integrated workflows
