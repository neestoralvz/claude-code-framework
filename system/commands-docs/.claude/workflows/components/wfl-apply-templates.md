# Apply Template Format Workflow

**Integrate Universal Workflows**: Use all workflow modules from the [Universal Workflows Index](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) for complete systematic template application.

## 1. Define Template Application Goals

### 1.1 State Primary Objective
Transform existing workflow files to conform to standardized template format with consistent structure and imperative tone.

### 1.2 List Specific Objectives
- Deploy content analysis agents to analyze target files for template application needs
- Deploy pattern detection specialists to identify repetitive content blocks across workflows
- Deploy template formatting agents to implement consistent structure and imperative tone
- Deploy modularization specialists to extract reusable workflow components
- Deploy validation agents to ensure complete template compliance and quality standards

## 2. Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents

**Apply Universal Exploration Deployment**: Follow systematic exploration methodology from [Universal Exploration Deployment Workflow](../modules/wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md) to deploy specialized agents across target workflow files and template requirements.

## 3. Read Essential Documentation

Read these documents before executing:
- Read [tpl-create-workflows.md](../templates/tpl-create-workflows.md) to understand master template structure and formatting
- Read target workflow files to analyze current content and organization
- Read [gui-create-commands.md](../../../principles/gui-create-commands.md) to learn formatting requirements

## 4. Establish Success Criteria

### 4.1 Define Success Requirements
- Achieve consistent template format application across all target workflow files
- Achieve imperative tone conversion for all action items and section headers
- Achieve conversion to clear, coherent, effective, specific, concise, and direct natural language commands
- Achieve universal module extraction for repetitive workflow phases with proper integration
- Achieve hierarchical numbering system implementation with logical section organization
- Achieve pattern analysis and modularization with elimination of duplicate content blocks
- Achieve reusable pattern module integration within workflow files for maintenance efficiency

### 4.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **Efficiency**: Template formatting completed in under 15 minutes per file - Calculate as actual_time <= 15_minutes
- **Quality**: 100% template structure compliance with consistent formatting - Calculate as compliant_sections / total_sections * 100
- **Language Clarity**: 100% instructions converted to imperative natural language - Calculate as imperative_instructions / total_instructions * 100
- **Module Extraction**: 100% repetitive phases extracted to universal modules - Calculate as extracted_phases / repetitive_phases * 100
- **Completeness**: All workflow sections formatted according to template standards - Calculate as formatted_sections / required_sections * 100
- **Pattern Optimization**: 90% reduction in duplicate content blocks - Calculate as (original_duplicates - remaining_duplicates) / original_duplicates * 100
- **Modularization**: 100% pattern modules integrated successfully - Calculate as integrated_modules / identified_patterns * 100

## 5. Create Implementation Plan

**Apply Universal Planning**: Follow systematic planning methodology from [Universal Planning Workflow](../modules/wfl-plan-execution.md) to design complete template application strategy and multi-agent deployment plan.

## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Apply Universal Execution**: Follow systematic implementation methodology from [Universal Execution Workflow](../modules/wfl-execute-plans.md) to deliver template application through coordinated multi-agent deployment.

## 7. Validate Complete Success

**Apply Universal Validation**: Follow four-gate validation methodology from [Universal Validation Workflow](../modules/wfl-validate-success.md) to verify template application success and ensure quality standards.

## 8. Iterate Until Perfect Results

**Apply Universal Recursion**: Follow systematic iteration methodology from [Universal Recursion Workflow](../modules/wfl-recurse-improvement.md) to achieve continuous improvement and complete template application success.

## 9. Manage System-Wide Impact

**Apply Universal Ripple Effect**: Follow systematic impact management from [Universal Ripple Effect Workflow](../modules/wfl-manage-effects.md) to coordinate cross-system changes and template application dependencies.

## 10. Connect Related Workflows

Present these workflow connections:
- **Prerequisite**: [wfl-organize-structure.md](wfl-organize-structure.md) - Execute before this workflow to establish proper directory organization
- **Parallel**: [wfl-maintain-system.md](wfl-maintain-system.md) - Execute simultaneously with this workflow to maintain system configuration
- **Follow-up**: [validate-workflow-integrity.md](validate-workflow-integrity.md) - Execute after this workflow to verify complete system integrity
- **Alternative**: [create-workflow-standards.md](create-workflow-standards.md) - Execute instead of this workflow for comprehensive workflow standardization approach
