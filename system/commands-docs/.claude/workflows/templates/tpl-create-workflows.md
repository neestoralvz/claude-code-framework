# [COMPOSITE WORKFLOW NAME]

**Integrate Universal Workflows**: Use all workflow modules from the [Universal Workflows Index](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) for complete systematic execution.

## 1. Define Complex Multi-Phase Goals

### 1.1 State Primary Objective
Define the main goal requiring multiple specialized agents and workflows.

### 1.2 List Specific Objectives
- Deploy specialized agents to complete [complex objective 1]
- Coordinate workflow sequences to achieve [complex objective 2]
- Orchestrate parallel agents to finish [complex objective 3]
- Apply cross-system integration to deliver [complex objective 4]

## 2. Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents

**Apply Universal Exploration Deployment**: Follow systematic exploration methodology from [Universal Exploration Deployment Workflow](../modules/wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md) to deploy specialized agents across system domains.

## 3. Read Essential Documentation

Read these documents before executing:
- Read [document-1.md](../docs/document-1.md) to understand core concepts
- Read [document-2.md](../docs/document-2.md) to verify system requirements  
- Read [document-3.md](../docs/document-3.md) to learn implementation patterns

## 4. Establish Success Criteria

### 4.1 Define Success Requirements
- Achieve [specific measurable criterion 1]
- Achieve [specific measurable criterion 2]
- Achieve [specific measurable criterion 3]

### 4.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **Efficiency**: [measurement] - Calculate as [formula]
- **Quality**: [measurement] - Calculate as [formula]
- **Completeness**: [measurement] - Calculate as [formula]

## 5. Create Implementation Plan

**Apply Universal Planning**: Follow systematic planning methodology from [Universal Planning Workflow](../modules/wfl-plan-execution.md) to design complete solution and implementation strategy.

## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Apply Universal Execution**: Follow systematic implementation methodology from [Universal Execution Workflow](../modules/wfl-execute-plans.md) to deliver solution through coordinated multi-agent deployment.

## 7. Validate Complete Success

**Apply Universal Validation**: Follow four-gate validation methodology from [Universal Validation Workflow](../modules/wfl-validate-success.md) to verify success and ensure quality standards.

## 8. Iterate Until Perfect Results

**Apply Universal Recursion**: Follow systematic iteration methodology from [Universal Recursion Workflow](../modules/wfl-recurse-improvement.md) to achieve continuous improvement and complete success.

## 9. Manage System-Wide Impact

**Apply Universal Ripple Effect**: Follow systematic impact management from [Universal Ripple Effect Workflow](../modules/wfl-manage-effects.md) to coordinate cross-system changes and dependencies.

## 10. Connect Related Workflows

Present these workflow connections:
- **Prerequisite**: [prerequisite-workflow.md] - Execute before this workflow
- **Parallel**: [parallel-workflow.md] - Execute simultaneously with this workflow
- **Follow-up**: [follow-up-workflow.md] - Execute after this workflow
- **Alternative**: [alternative-workflow.md] - Execute instead of this workflow
