## Integration Guidelines

### Command Integration
1. **Embed Recursion Points**: Identify natural recursion opportunities
2. **Configure Termination Criteria**: Define clear success and limit conditions
3. **Implement Learning Loops**: Apply insights from previous iterations
4. **Maintain Quality Standards**: Ensure continuous improvement maintains quality

### Agent Deployment
1. **Recursive Agent Coordination**: Deploy agents for iterative improvement
2. **Cross-Iteration Learning**: Share insights between recursive cycles
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build upon previous iteration successes
4. **Coordinated Termination**: Synchronized multi-agent recursion completion

### Ecosystem Coordination
1. **Registry Updates**: Track recursive iterations and improvements
2. **Cross-Reference Maintenance**: Update relationships during recursion
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Document recursive learning and insights
4. **System Integration**: Coordinate recursion across framework components

## Usage Patterns

### For Simple Recursion (1-2 iterations)
- Execute basic corrective recursion for immediate issue resolution
- Apply minimal optimization focus
- Validate direct success criteria

### For Moderate Recursion (2-5 iterations)
