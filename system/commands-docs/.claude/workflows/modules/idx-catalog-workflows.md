# Universal Workflows Index

Use systematic methodology through universal workflow patterns. Apply modular design from [gui-apply-solid.md](../../../principles/gui-apply-solid.md) for comprehensive reusability across all commands.

Access universal workflow components. Integrate into any command or operational context.

## Universal Workflow Components

### ðŸŽ¯ [Universal Planning Workflow](wfl-plan-execution.md)
Design systematic solutions. Plan implementation approach.
Include in any command requiring structured problem-solving.

Execute context analysis. Design solution architecture. Plan validation strategy. Coordinate integration patterns.

Apply in command planning phases. Deploy planning specialists for complex scenarios. Setup comprehensive verification protocols.

### âœ… [Universal Success Validation Workflow](wfl-validate-success.md)
Verify success comprehensively. Ensure quality assurance.
Apply to all commands requiring systematic outcome validation.

Execute four-gate validation framework (Requirements â†’ Process â†’ Output â†’ System). Apply mathematical success criteria. Collect evidence and documentation. Implement failure response protocols.

Verify all command objectives achieved. Validate specialist task completion. Ensure engineering standards satisfaction.

### ðŸ”„ [Universal Recursion Workflow](wfl-recurse-improvement.md)
Iterate systematically. Improve continuously.
Integrate in commands requiring iterative enhancement or failure recovery.

Apply recursive framework architecture (Corrective, Optimization, Preventive). Integrate learning and knowledge application. Manage termination criteria. Coordinate multi-agent recursive patterns.

Trigger automatic recursion on validation failure. Execute continuous improvement cycles. Elevate quality standards progressively.

### ðŸŒŠ [Universal Ripple Effect Workflow](wfl-manage-effects.md)
Manage impact comprehensively. Coordinate cross-system effects.
Apply when command execution affects multiple system components.

Analyze direct and indirect dependencies. Manage cross-references and registry synchronization. Coordinate integration levels (Local â†’ Domain â†’ System â†’ Enterprise). Apply automated and manual coordination mechanisms.

Manage implementation consequences. Coordinate multi-agent impact effects. Maintain system-wide consistency.

### âš¡ [Universal Plan Execution Workflow](wfl-execute-plans.md)
Implement systematically. Deliver solutions effectively.
Include in commands requiring structured execution methodology.

Apply multiple execution patterns (Linear, Parallel, Iterative, Agile). Manage resources (Human, Technical, Information). Monitor progress in real-time with adaptive control. Integrate quality assurance.

Deliver systematic solutions. Execute coordinated specialist deployment. Complete structured phase-by-phase delivery.

## Integration Architecture

### Command Integration Pattern
Integrate workflows systematically:

**Planning Phase**: Import universal planning workflow. Customize for command-specific requirements. Validate planning completeness and accuracy.

**Execution Phase**: Import universal plan execution workflow. Coordinate resource and timeline management. Monitor progress and quality metrics.

**Validation Phase**: Import universal success validation workflow. Execute four-gate validation framework. Document evidence and completion verification.

**Ripple Phase**: Import universal ripple effect workflow. Assess impact and dependency management. Coordinate cross-system integration.

**Recursion Capability**: Import universal recursion workflow. Configure termination criteria and learning integration. Enable continuous improvement and optimization.

### Agent Coordination Pattern
Coordinate multi-agent deployment:

**Planning**: Deploy planning-specialist for complex solution design.
**Execution**: Deploy domain specialists for implementation.
**Validation**: Deploy validation-engineer for quality assurance.
**Coordination**: Deploy workflow-coordinator for integration.

### Template Integration Pattern
```yaml
template_workflow_integration:
  enhanced_commands:
    - embed_planning: Include planning workflow in command template
    - embed_validation: Include validation workflow in command template
    - embed_execution: Include execution workflow in command template
    - embed_recursion: Include recursion capability in command template
    - embed_ripple: Include impact management in command template
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Workflow Selection Matrix
| Command Complexity | Planning | Execution | Validation | Ripple | Recursion |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Simple (1-10 min) | Basic | Linear | Basic | Local | Corrective |
| Moderate (10-30 min) | Standard | Parallel | Standard | Domain | Optimization |
| Complex (30+ min) | Comprehensive | Iterative | Comprehensive | System | Full Framework |
| Enterprise (60+ min) | Enhanced | Agile | Critical | Enterprise | Strategic |

### Integration Best Practices

#### 1. Workflow Composition
- **Sequential Integration**: Plan â†’ Execute â†’ Validate â†’ Ripple â†’ (Recurse if needed)
- **Embedded Integration**: Include workflow components within command phases
- **Modular Application**: Use only required workflow components based on complexity

#### 2. Customization Guidelines
- **Context Adaptation**: Modify workflows for domain-specific requirements
- **Scale Adjustment**: Apply appropriate complexity level for task scope
- **Integration Optimization**: Streamline workflow coordination for efficiency

#### 3. Quality Assurance
- **Validation Integration**: Ensure all workflows include quality checkpoints
- **Evidence Documentation**: Collect validation proof for all workflow applications
- **Continuous Improvement**: Apply learning from workflow execution
