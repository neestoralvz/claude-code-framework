# Universal Planning Workflow

Implement systematic methodology through universal planning patterns. Apply quality gates from [gui-apply-solid.md](../../../principles/gui-apply-solid.md) for comprehensive solution design.

Plan systematic solution design across all commands and contexts.

## Core Planning Process

### Phase 1: Context Analysis
```yaml
context_analysis:
  requirement_assessment:
    - stakeholder_identification: Map all affected parties and systems
    - constraint_analysis: Technical, resource, and timeline limitations
    - success_criteria_definition: Measurable completion requirements
    - risk_assessment: Potential failure points and mitigation strategies
  
  environment_evaluation:
    - current_state_analysis: Existing system and context assessment
    - dependency_mapping: Required resources and external dependencies
    - integration_requirements: Ecosystem coordination needs
    - validation_framework: Quality assurance and compliance verification
```

### Phase 2: Solution Architecture
```yaml
solution_design:
  approach_definition:
    - methodology_selection: Optimal implementation approach
    - phase_breakdown: Sequential execution steps
    - resource_allocation: Team, tools, and time distribution
    - quality_gates: Embedded validation checkpoints
  
  implementation_strategy:
    - execution_sequence: Step-by-step implementation process
    - parallel_opportunities: Concurrent execution possibilities
    - integration_coordination: Cross-system alignment requirements
    - rollback_procedures: Failure recovery and reversal protocols
```

### Phase 3: Validation Planning
```yaml
validation_strategy:
  quality_framework:
    - compliance_verification: Standards and architecture validation
    - integration_testing: Ecosystem coordination verification
    - success_validation: Measurable outcome achievement confirmation
    - evidence_collection: Documentation and proof requirements
  
  monitoring_setup:
    - progress_tracking: Execution milestone monitoring
    - quality_metrics: Continuous quality assessment
    - risk_monitoring: Early warning system implementation
    - stakeholder_communication: Progress reporting protocols
```

## Integration Patterns

### Command Integration
- Import planning phase into command operational framework
- Apply context analysis to command-specific requirements
- Customize validation strategy for command complexity level

### Agent Coordination
- Deploy planning-specialist agent for complex solution design
- Coordinate with domain specialists for technical requirements
- Integrate with validation-engineer for quality assurance

### Ecosystem Coordination
- Registry updates for planning artifact management
- Cross-reference establishment with related components
- Template system integration for consistency

## Usage Guidelines

### For Simple Tasks (1-10 min)
- Focus on Phase 1 context analysis
- Apply minimal Phase 2 solution architecture
- Implement basic validation planning

### For Moderate Tasks (10-30 min)
- Complete Phase 1 and Phase 2
- Apply standard validation framework
- Plan integration coordination

### For Complex Tasks (30+ min)
- Execute full three-phase planning process
- Implement comprehensive validation strategy
- Coordinate extensive ecosystem integration

### For Enterprise Tasks (60+ min)
- Apply enhanced planning with predictive analysis
- Plan multi-stakeholder coordination
- Implement continuous monitoring and adaptation protocols

Include this workflow in any command requiring systematic solution design and implementation planning.

## Customization Points

### Domain-Specific Adaptations
- **Technical Planning**: Focus on architecture and implementation details
- **Process Planning**: Emphasize workflow and coordination patterns
- **Resource Planning**: Highlight allocation and timeline optimization
- **Quality Planning**: Integrate comprehensive validation frameworks

### Validation Level Customization
- **Basic**: Essential planning checkpoints
- **Standard**: Comprehensive planning with quality gates
- **Comprehensive**: Full validation integration
- **Critical**: Maximum planning rigor with continuous monitoring

Apply this universal planning workflow across all commands requiring systematic solution design.
