# Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents

## 1. Define Exploration Scope

### 1.1 State Exploration Objective
Define system domains requiring comprehensive exploration and analysis.

### 1.2 Identify Target Systems
- Identify primary system domains for specialized analysis
- Identify architectural components for investigation
- Identify dependency networks for mapping
- Identify integration points for cross-system coordination

## 2. Deploy Specialized Exploration Agents

Deploy exploration agents across system domains:
- Deploy specialized analysis agents to explore target system domains
- Deploy architectural investigation agents to explore system components
- Deploy dependency mapping specialists to explore network relationships  
- Deploy integration analysis agents to explore cross-system connections

## 3. Coordinate Parallel Exploration

Execute coordinated exploration across multiple domains:
- Coordinate simultaneous exploration to maximize efficiency
- Coordinate information sharing between exploration agents
- Coordinate comprehensive coverage of all identified system domains
- Coordinate integration analysis across system boundaries

## 4. Validate Exploration Results

Verify comprehensive exploration completion:
- Validate complete coverage of all identified system domains
- Validate quality of exploration findings and analysis
- Validate integration between different exploration results
- Validate readiness for next workflow phase

## 5. Present Exploration Findings

Consolidate and present exploration results:
- Present system domain analysis findings
- Present architectural investigation results  
- Present dependency mapping outcomes
- Present cross-system integration insights

## Success Criteria

### Completion Requirements
- Complete exploration of all identified system domains
- Complete analysis from all deployed exploration agents
- Complete coordination between parallel exploration efforts
- Complete validation of exploration findings quality

### Quality Standards
- **Coverage**: [100% of identified domains explored] - Calculate as explored_domains / identified_domains * 100
- **Quality**: [Exploration findings meet analysis standards] - Calculate as quality_findings / total_findings * 100
- **Coordination**: [All agents coordinate effectively] - Calculate as successful_coordinations / total_coordinations * 100
- **Integration**: [Findings integrate across system boundaries] - Calculate as integrated_findings / total_findings * 100
