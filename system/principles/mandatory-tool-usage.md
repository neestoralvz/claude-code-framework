# Mandatory Tool Usage

**Context**: Fundamental principle defining framework behavior and decision-making


Always use the right tools for each task consistently throughout your work.

## Why This Matters

Tools exist to solve specific problems well. When you skip using appropriate tools, you end up doing manual work that could be automated, miss important information, or create inconsistent results.

## How to Apply

Identify the tools that solve your common problems and make using them non negotiable. Set up your environment so the tools are easy to access and use. Create checklists or automation that reminds you to use the right tools.

## Real Examples

Claude Code mandates using TodoWrite for task tracking, Context7 for library documentation, and WebSearch for current information. This ensures consistent, thorough work without forgetting important steps.

## Tool Categories

Planning tools for breaking down complex work, research tools for finding current information, validation tools for checking results, and automation tools for repetitive tasks.
