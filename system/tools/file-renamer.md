# File Renamer

**Context**: Utility tool supporting framework maintenance and operations


**[System](../INDEX.md) › [Tools](../TOOLS.md) › File Renamer**

Quick tool for standardizing file names.

## Process
1. Identify files with non-standard names
2. Apply simple naming rules - lowercase, hyphens, descriptive
3. Make names shorter and more direct
4. Update all references to renamed files
5. Verify navigation still works

## Quick Rules
- Remove unnecessary words like "and", "the", "of"
- Use action verbs when possible
- Keep under 4 words when possible
- Make it immediately clear what the file contains
