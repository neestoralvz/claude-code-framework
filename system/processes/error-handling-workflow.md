# Error Handling Workflow

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns


How to systematically handle errors when they occur in your work.

## When Something Goes Wrong

First, capture the specific error with full details including what you were trying to do, what input caused the problem, and what the system said went wrong.

## Error Analysis Process

Look at the error type and context to understand if this is a validation problem, a missing resource, a configuration issue, or something else. Check if similar errors have happened before and how they were resolved.

## Recovery Strategies

For validation errors, fix the input data and try again. For missing resources, create or locate what you need. For configuration problems, check your settings and dependencies. For unexpected errors, research the specific error message.

## Prevention Planning

After fixing the immediate problem, think about how to prevent the same error from happening again. Add validation checks, improve error messages, or update documentation to help future troubleshooting.

## Documentation

Record what went wrong, how you fixed it, and what you changed to prevent it. This creates a knowledge base for handling similar problems faster next time.
