# Extended Thinking Workflow

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns


How to systematically work through complex problems that require deep analysis.

## When to Use Extended Thinking

When facing complex problems with multiple components, unclear requirements, or potential ripple effects. Use this for architectural decisions, debugging complex issues, or planning significant changes.

## Think Through the Problem

Break down the problem into smaller components. Identify what you know, what you need to find out, and what assumptions you're making. Map out relationships between different parts of the problem.

## Explore Multiple Approaches

Generate several possible solutions before committing to one. Consider the tradeoffs of each approach including complexity, maintainability, performance, and future flexibility.

## Plan Implementation Steps

Once you choose an approach, break it down into specific, actionable steps. Identify dependencies between steps and potential risks or obstacles.

## Execute with Validation

Implement one step at a time, validating results before moving to the next step. This allows you to catch problems early and adjust your approach if needed.

## Reflect and Document

After completing the work, document what you learned, what worked well, and what you would do differently next time. This builds knowledge for future complex problems.
