# Strategic Problem-Solving Workflow

**Context**: Evidence-based strategic analysis and solution design process for complex problems requiring comprehensive investigation

**Purpose**: Systematic approach to strategic problem-solving using tiered complexity assessment, integrated methodologies, and evidence-based validation

---

## Process Overview

Strategic problem-solving for complex challenges requiring comprehensive analysis, stakeholder integration, and sustainable solution design.

## Complexity Assessment

### 1. Problem Classification

**Simple Problems** - Use basic analysis:
- 5 Whys root cause analysis
- Basic evidence validation
- Single-agent execution
- Direct implementation

**Moderate Complexity** - Use enhanced methodology:
- Fishbone diagram analysis
- Design thinking approach
- Multi-agent coordination
- Stakeholder integration

**High Complexity** - Use full strategic framework:
- Fault tree analysis
- Military Decision-Making Process (MDMP) adaptation
- Parallel agent coordination
- Comprehensive evidence framework
- Sustainability impact assessment

### 2. Complexity Indicators

**Simple Problem Indicators**:
- Single domain impact
- Limited stakeholders
- Well-understood requirements

- Coordination requirements

**High Complexity Indicators**:
- Systems-level impact
- Complex stakeholder networks
- Significant unknowns
- Strategic implications
- Long-term consequences
