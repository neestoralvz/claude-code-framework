# Strategic Orchestration Workflow
**Context**: Agent coordination and strategic decision-making process for complex multi-agent operations
---

## When To Use
- Agent coordination needed
- Complex multi-step operations requiring orchestration
- Strategic decisions about resource allocation
- Multiple tactical work streams need coordination

## Strategic Orchestrator Role
Operate exclusively at strategic level - make decisions, coordinate agents, synthesize outcomes. Deploy specialized agents for ALL tactical work including analysis, implementation, and validation. Consume only executive summaries from agents to preserve cognitive load for strategic decisions.

## Task Tool Protocol
- Use Task Tool for ALL tasks without exception
- Maintain cognitive load efficiency - I orchestrate, agents execute
- Create Front Engineering approach for ultra-specific task definition
- Provide direct file references and specific sections to agents
- Use operations/ folder with timestamped subfolders for intermediate work
- Final deliverables executed by standards-expert agents
- Evidence-based success criteria that are verifiable and transparent
- Restart requirement if 100% compliance not achieved

## Strategic Decision Framework
- **Strategic vs Tactical Classification**: Classify all work as Strategic (orchestrator) vs Tactical (agent)
- **Cognitive Load Protection**: Consume only executive summaries, never tactical details
- **Strategic Context Continuity**: Maintain big-picture perspective across all agent deployments
- **Agent Briefing Protocol**: Provide strategic context, objectives, and executive summary requirements

## Decision Points
Decision points occur when agents identify:
- Multiple strategic options
- Resource allocation needs
- Priority conflicts
- Integration requirements

**Decision Process**: 
1. Synthesize agent summaries
2. Analyze strategic alternatives
3. Assess implications
4. Choose direction
5. Deploy agents to execute
6. Document decisions for strategic continuity

## Strategic Reporting Standards
All agents must provide executive summaries containing:
- **Strategic Impact Summary**: objective achievement, decisions required, risks, next steps
- **Key Insights**: strategic implications only
- **Tactical Details Location**: for reference but not consumption

Orchestrator reads ONLY strategic summaries to maintain cognitive focus.

## Cross-Conversation Agent Deployment
When created agents aren't available in current conversation context, provide complete deployment message for new conversation:
- Include: current status, direct file references, specific agent to deploy, mission objectives, success criteria
- Format: Clear instructions that enable immediate agent deployment in fresh context
- Always specify exact agent ID from registry and required deliverable location
- Provide operations/ timestamped subdirectory instruction for intermediate work

### Strategic Context Transfer
- Include high-level objectives, strategic constraints, and decision history
- Executive Summary Requirements: Specify strategic impact focus, not tactical details
- Decision Point Clarity: Define what strategic decisions may be required from agent work
