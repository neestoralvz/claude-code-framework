   - Always include current year (2025) in search queries
   - Review multiple results to identify best sources
   - Focus on authoritative, current information

2. **Analysis Phase - WebFetch**
   - Use WebFetch on specific URLs from WebSearch results
   - Extract detailed content from the most relevant sources
   - Process and analyze the content systematically
   - Synthesize information from multiple sources

Search Query → WebSearch → Review Results → Select URLs → WebFetch → Analyze Content → Synthesize Findings
```

### Best Practices

- **IF exploring unfamiliar topics** that require comprehensive understanding
- **IF need authoritative sources** for decision-making
- **IF researching best practices** or current approaches
