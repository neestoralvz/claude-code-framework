# Root Cause Analysis Workflow

**Context**: Systematic investigation and elimination of underlying issues using evidence-based methodologies

**Purpose**: Identify and address fundamental causes rather than symptoms through structured analysis techniques

---

## Process Overview

Systematic investigation of problems to identify underlying causes and develop lasting solutions that eliminate issues at their source.

## Analysis Methodology Selection

### Phase 3: Root Cause Investigation (30-90 minutes)

**Objectives**:

- Identify underlying causes systematically
- Validate cause-effect relationships
- Prioritize root causes by impact

#### 5 Whys Technique (Simple Issues)

**Process**:
1. Start with problem statement
2. Ask "Why does this happen?" and document answer
3. For each answer, ask "Why?" again
4. Continue until root cause identified (typically 5 iterations)
5. Validate root cause through evidence

**Example Structure**:
```
Problem: Website loading slowly
Why 1: Database queries taking too long
Why 2: Query optimization not implemented
Why 3: Performance monitoring not in place
Why 4: Development process lacks performance review
Why 5: No performance standards established
Root Cause: Missing performance standards and review process
```

#### Fishbone Diagram (Moderate Complexity)

**Categories for Analysis**:
- **People**: Human factors, skills, training
- **Process**: Procedures, workflows, methods
- **Materials**: Resources, inputs, supplies
- **Machines**: Equipment, tools, technology
- **Environment**: Conditions, context, external factors
- **Measurement**: Metrics, monitoring, feedback

**Process**:
1. Define problem as fish head
2. Create category branches (fishbones)
3. Brainstorm causes within each category
4. Analyze relationships between causes
5. Identify primary root causes
6. Validate through evidence

#### Fault Tree Analysis (High Complexity)

**Process**:
1. Define top-level failure event
2. Identify immediate causes using logic gates
3. Decompose each cause into sub-causes
4. Continue until basic events identified
5. Analyze failure paths and probabilities
6. Identify critical failure points

**Logic Gates**:
- **AND**: All inputs must occur for output
- **OR**: Any input can cause output
- **Priority AND**: Inputs must occur in sequence
- **Inhibit**: Input occurs only if condition met

### Phase 4: Cause Validation and Prioritization (20-40 minutes)

**Objectives**:
- Validate identified root causes with evidence
- Assess impact and probability of each cause
- Prioritize causes for solution development
- Document validation rationale
