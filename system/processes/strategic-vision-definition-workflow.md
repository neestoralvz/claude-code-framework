### Phase 2: Vision Foundation Development (Clarity Stage)

**Objectives**:
- Establish clear mission statement
- Define compelling future vision
- Identify core values and principles
- Create stakeholder alignment framework

**Activities**:

1. **Mission Definition**
   - Why does this project exist?
   - What fundamental need or opportunity does it address?
   - What value will it create for stakeholders?
   - How does it align with broader organizational/personal goals?

2. **Vision Statement Creation**
   - Where do we want to be when the project succeeds?
   - What will success look like in concrete terms?
   - How will stakeholders benefit from the outcome?
   - What broader impact will the project have?

3. **Core Values Identification**
   - What principles guide project decisions?
   - What behaviors and approaches are non-negotiable?
   - How do we handle trade-offs and conflicts?
   - What standards define quality and success?

4. **Stakeholder Alignment Framework**
   - How do stakeholder interests align with the vision?
   - What value proposition speaks to each stakeholder group?
   - Where are potential conflicts and how to resolve them?
   - What communication strategy ensures ongoing alignment?

**Deliverables**:
- Clear mission statement (1-2 sentences)
- Compelling vision statement (2-3 sentences)
- Core values list with behavioral descriptions
- Stakeholder value proposition mapping

**Validation Criteria**:
- Mission statement clearly answers "why"
- Vision statement is specific, inspiring, and achievable
- Core values are actionable and measurable
- Stakeholder alignment is documented and validated

### Phase 3: Strategic Objectives Definition (Structure Stage)

**Objectives**:
- Transform vision into specific objectives
- Ensure objectives are SMART and measurable
- Create hierarchical objective structure
- Establish dependency and capability mapping

**Activities**:

1. **Objective Hierarchical Structure**
   - **Strategic Objectives** (Vision achievement outcomes)
   - **Tactical Objectives** (Capability development milestones)
   - **Operational Objectives** (Implementation deliverables)
   - **Foundation Objectives** (Prerequisite establishment actions)

2. **SMART Criteria Application**
   - **Specific**: Clear, unambiguous objective statements
   - **Measurable**: Quantifiable success indicators
   - **Achievable**: Realistic given resources and constraints
   - **Relevant**: Aligned with vision and stakeholder value
   - **Milestone-bound**: Clear achievement markers and completion criteria

3. **Objective Dependency Mapping**
   - Sequential dependencies (must achieve A before B becomes possible)
   - Parallel opportunities (can develop simultaneously)
   - Capability sharing requirements
   - Critical achievement path identification

4. **Priority and Impact Assessment**
   - High/Medium/Low priority classification
   - Impact scoring (stakeholder value delivery)
   - Risk assessment for each objective
   - Resource requirement estimation

**Deliverables**:
- Hierarchical objectives structure with clear levels
- SMART-compliant objective statements
- Dependency map showing relationships and critical achievement path
- Priority matrix with impact and capability assessments

**Quality Standards**:
- All objectives pass SMART criteria validation
- Dependencies are clearly documented and logical
- Priority assessment is evidence-based
- Capability estimates are realistic and detailed

### Phase 4: Stakeholder Validation and Refinement (Consensus Stage)

**Objectives**:
- Validate vision and objectives with key stakeholders
- Incorporate feedback and resolve conflicts
- Build consensus and commitment
- Finalize strategic direction

**Activities**:

1. **Stakeholder Validation Sessions**
   - Present vision, mission, and objectives
   - Collect structured feedback
   - Identify concerns and resistance points
   - Document suggested modifications

2. **Feedback Integration and Conflict Resolution**
   - Analyze feedback patterns and themes
   - Prioritize suggestions based on stakeholder influence
   - Resolve conflicting requirements through negotiation
   - Update vision and objectives based on valid feedback
