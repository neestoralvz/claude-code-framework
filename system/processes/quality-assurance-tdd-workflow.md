## Project Quality Setup

### Initial Quality Configuration

**Scenario: New Project Quality Setup**
```gherkin
Given a new development project requiring quality assurance
When the project is initialized with quality frameworks
Then all quality gates should be configured and baseline metrics established
```

**Quality Setup Steps:**
1. **Configure Jest with Coverage**: Set up comprehensive test coverage reporting
2. **Integrate ESLint/Prettier**: Establish code quality and formatting standards
3. **Setup SonarQube**: Configure static analysis and technical debt tracking
4. **Configure CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate quality gates into deployment process
5. **Establish Metrics Dashboard**: Create real-time quality visibility

**Validation Criteria:**
- All quality tools execute successfully
- Baseline metrics captured for future comparison
- Quality gates integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Team has access to quality dashboards

### Quality Tools Configuration

**Jest Configuration for Comprehensive Coverage:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 90,
      functions: 90,
      lines: 90,
      statements: 90
    }
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{js,ts}',
    '!src/**/*.test.{js,ts}',
    '!src/**/__mocks__/**'
  ],
  coverageReporters: ['text', 'html', 'lcov', 'json-summary'],
  testMatch: [
    '<rootDir>/src/**/__tests__/**/*.(js|ts)',
    '<rootDir>/src/**/?(*.)(test|spec).(js|ts)'
  ]
};
```

**ESLint Configuration for Code Quality:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  extends: [
    'eslint:recommended',
    '@typescript-eslint/recommended'
  ],
  rules: {
    'complexity': ['error', 10],
    'max-lines-per-function': ['error', 50],
    'max-depth': ['error', 4],
    'no-console': 'warn',
    'prefer-const': 'error'
  }
};
```

**Quality Gate Integration:**
```yaml
quality_gates:
  unit_tests:
    threshold: 90
    blocking: true
  integration_tests:
    threshold: 80
    blocking: true
  code_coverage:
    threshold: 90
    blocking: true
  static_analysis:
    critical_issues: 0
    blocking: true
```

## Quality Baseline Establishment

**Scenario: Quality Baseline Creation**
```gherkin
Given a project with initial codebase
When quality metrics are first measured
Then baseline metrics should be established for future comparison
```

**Baseline Metrics to Capture:**
- **Code Coverage**: Current percentage across all coverage types
- **Technical Debt**: Initial technical debt ratio and code smells
- **Complexity Metrics**: Cyclomatic and cognitive complexity averages
- **Test Quality**: Test count, test-to-code ratio, test execution time
- **Documentation Coverage**: API documentation and scenario coverage

**Baseline Validation:**
- All metrics successfully captured
- Historical tracking initialized
- Quality trends analysis available
- Team understands baseline meaning and improvement targets

## TDD Quality Integration

### Red Phase Quality Checks

**Scenario: Test-First Quality Validation**
```gherkin
Given a developer writing a failing test for new functionality
When the test is created using TDD practices
Then the test should meet quality standards and properly fail
```

**Quality Validations:**
1. **Test Structure**: Follows Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. **Test Naming**: Clear, descriptive test names explaining behavior
3. **Test Isolation**: Tests don't depend on other tests or external state
4. **Failure Reason**: Test fails for the expected reason
5. **Test Coverage**: New test increases overall coverage

**Automated Quality Checks:**
- Test naming convention validation
- Test isolation verification (no shared state)
- Proper assertion usage (no empty tests)
- Mock and stub usage appropriateness
- Test readability and maintainability scores

### Green Phase Quality Validation

**Scenario: Minimal Implementation Quality**
```gherkin
Given a failing test that needs implementation
When minimal code is written to make the test pass
Then the implementation should meet quality gates while remaining minimal
```

**Quality Validations:**
1. **Code Coverage**: Implementation increases coverage appropriately
2. **Complexity**: New code doesn't exceed complexity thresholds
3. **Code Quality**: Follows established coding standards
4. **Test Passing**: All tests pass including the new test
5. **No Over-Engineering**: Implementation is truly minimal

**Automated Quality Checks:**
- Static analysis on new code only
- Complexity analysis for new functions
- Code coverage delta calculation
- Performance impact assessment
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Refactor Phase Quality Assurance

**Scenario: Safe Refactoring with Quality Improvement**
```gherkin
Given working code that needs improvement
When refactoring while maintaining test coverage
Then code quality should improve while all tests continue passing
```

**Quality Validations:**
1. **Test Stability**: All tests continue to pass during refactoring
2. **Coverage Maintenance**: Code coverage remains stable or improves
3. **Complexity Reduction**: Cyclomatic/cognitive complexity decreases
4. **Code Quality**: Technical debt reduces, code smells eliminated
5. **Performance**: No significant performance degradation

**Quality Improvement Metrics:**
- Before/after complexity comparison
- Technical debt reduction measurement
- Code maintainability index improvement
- Test execution time optimization
- Documentation clarity enhancement

## BDD Quality Validation

### Scenario Quality Standards

**Scenario: High-Quality Behavior Scenarios**
```gherkin
Given business requirements that need specification
When scenarios are written using BDD practices
Then scenarios should be clear, testable, and business-focused
```

**Quality Standards:**
1. **Structure**: Proper Given-When-Then format
2. **Language**: Business language, not technical jargon
3. **Specificity**: Concrete examples rather than abstract descriptions
4. **Testability**: Scenarios can be automated and verified
5. **Business Value**: Clear connection to user needs and business goals

**Scenario Quality Metrics:**
- Scenario clarity score (stakeholder feedback)
- Automation percentage (how many scenarios are automated)
- Business language usage (technical term detection)
- Scenario independence (no scenario dependencies)
- Acceptance criteria coverage (all criteria have scenarios)

### Living Documentation Quality

**Scenario: Maintaining Current Documentation**
```gherkin
Given automated scenarios serving as documentation
When code changes affect system behavior
Then documentation should automatically update to reflect current state
```

**Documentation Quality Checks:**
1. **Accuracy**: Documentation matches actual system behavior
2. **Completeness**: All features and behaviors documented
3. **Freshness**: Documentation updated with every relevant change
4. **Accessibility**: Documentation easily accessible to all stakeholders
5. **Usefulness**: Documentation helps users understand system behavior

**Automated Documentation Validation:**

2. **Code Quality Score**: Composite score including complexity, maintainability
3. **Technical Debt Ratio**: Current debt with trend analysis
4. **Build Health**: Test pass rate, build success rate, deployment frequency
5. **Performance Metrics**: Test execution time, build time, response times

**Dashboard Alerts:**
- Coverage drops below threshold
- Quality score decreases significantly
- Technical debt increases beyond acceptable levels
- Build failures exceed acceptable rate
- Performance degradation detected

### Automated Quality Reporting
