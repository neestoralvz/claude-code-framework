# Parallel Execution Workflow

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns


How to handle multiple similar tasks efficiently by running them at the same time.

## When to Use Parallel Execution

When you have multiple independent tasks that can run simultaneously, like processing several files, validating multiple inputs, or making several API calls. The key is that tasks must not depend on each other.

## Setup Process

Identify which tasks can run in parallel by checking their dependencies. Group similar tasks together. Set up the execution environment to handle multiple tasks safely without conflicts.

## Execution Management

Start all parallel tasks and monitor their progress. Track which tasks complete successfully and which encounter errors. Handle resource limits to avoid overwhelming the system.

## Result Coordination

Collect results from all parallel tasks as they complete. Handle partial failures where some tasks succeed and others fail. Combine successful results while managing any errors appropriately.

## Real Examples

Processing multiple customer records simultaneously, validating several form submissions in parallel, or running tests across multiple configurations at once.
