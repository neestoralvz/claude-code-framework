# Research and Document

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns


Process for finding current information and preserving it in our system.

## When to Use Research
- Need current library documentation or examples
- Looking for updated best practices
- Want to find real-world implementation patterns
- Building on existing knowledge rather than reinventing

## Research Sources
- **Context7** - Current library documentation and code examples
- **WebSearch** - Updated Anthropic documentation and recent information
- **Our own system** - Examples and processes we've already documented

## Documentation Process
1. Search for relevant information using appropriate tools
2. Extract key insights and practical examples
3. Document findings in appropriate system location
4. Create examples showing real usage patterns
5. Update our processes based on new learning

## Documentation Locations
- **Examples** - Real-world usage patterns and decisions
- **Standards** - Consistent approaches we should follow
- **Processes** - Step-by-step workflows
- **Tools** - Utilities and scripts for automation
