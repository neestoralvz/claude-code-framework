# Automate or Manual

**Context**: Workflow process defining procedural steps and execution patterns


**[System](../INDEX.md) › [Processes](../PROCESSES.md) › Automate or Manual**

Decision process for choosing between manual work and automation.

## Quick Decision Tree

**Is it more than 5 similar items?** → Consider automation
**Is it the exact same pattern repeated?** → Script it
**Will you need to do this again later?** → Automate
**Is there risk of human error?** → Use scripts
**Is it a one-time simple task?** → Do manually

## Red Flags for Manual Work
- Catching yourself doing the same edit repeatedly
- Thinking "this is tedious but I'll power through"
- Risk of missing files or being inconsistent
- Large number of files to change

## Green Lights for Scripts
- Clear, systematic pattern
- Multiple files need identical changes
- Task will need repeating in future
- Human error could cause problems

## When in Doubt
Start with a small manual test, then automate if the pattern is clear and systematic.
