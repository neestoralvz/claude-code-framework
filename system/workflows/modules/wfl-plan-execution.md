**Apply Universal Execution**: Follow systematic implementation methodology from [Universal Execution Workflow](wfl-execute-plans.md) to deliver planning through coordinated multi-agent deployment.

### 6.1 Execute This Three-Step Planning Process

**Step 1: Understand What You're Working With**

**Assess Your Requirements**
- Identify everyone who cares about this work and will be affected by it
- List your limitations: time constraints, available tools, budget, and skills
- Define exactly what success looks like with specific, measurable goals
- Spot potential problems early and plan how to handle them

**Evaluate Your Starting Point**
- Examine what currently exists and how it works
- Map out what resources and help you'll need
- Determine how your work connects with other systems or people
- Set up your quality checks and compliance requirements

**Step 2: Design Your Solution**

**Define Your Approach**
- Choose the best method to tackle this work
- Break down your work into clear, manageable steps
- Allocate your time, tools, and team members effectively
- Build in checkpoints to verify quality as you go

**Plan Your Implementation**
- Create a detailed sequence of what you'll do first, second, third
- Identify tasks you can work on simultaneously to save time
- Plan how your work will connect with existing systems
- Prepare backup plans if something goes wrong

**Step 3: Set Up Success Monitoring**

**Create Your Quality Framework**
- Verify your work meets all standards and requirements
- Test how well your solution works with everything else
- Confirm you've achieved your measurable success goals
- Collect evidence and documentation to prove your success

**Establish Progress Tracking**
- Monitor your milestones and deadlines throughout the work
- Measure quality continuously, not just at the end
- Watch for warning signs of problems developing
- Keep stakeholders informed with regular progress updates

## ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY**: Orchestrators must use Task tools for agent deployment
**AGENT FREEDOM**: Deployed agents execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob tools
**PARALLEL PATTERN**: Deploy independent agents simultaneously within single orchestrator message
**COORDINATION PATTERN**: Use sequential Task deployment for dependent operations

### TASK TOOL DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLES

**Requirements Analysis**:
Task(subagent_type: "requirements-analysis-specialist", description: "assess-stakeholder-constraints", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the requirements-analysis-specialist agent. Identify stakeholders, limitations, success criteria, potential problems. DELIVERABLES: Requirements analysis operations/[conversation-id]/requirements-analysis-results")

**Solution Design**:
Task(subagent_type: "solution-design-specialist", description: "develop-systematic-approach", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the solution-design-specialist agent. Choose methodology, break down work, allocate resources, plan implementation sequence. DELIVERABLES: Solution design operations/[conversation-id]/solution-design-results")

**Quality Framework**:
Task(subagent_type: "quality-framework-specialist", description: "setup-monitoring-tracking", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the quality-framework-specialist agent. Create quality verification, establish progress tracking, set up evidence collection. DELIVERABLES: Quality framework operations/[conversation-id]/quality-framework-results")
