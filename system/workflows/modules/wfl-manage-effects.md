### 6.1 Quick Start Guide

**Before Making Any Change:**
1. Ask yourself: "What else will this affect?"
2. Map out all connections and dependencies
3. Plan how to handle each consequence
4. Execute your change with proper coordination
5. Monitor the results and adjust as needed

### 6.2 Core Process: Analyze Impact Before Acting

**Step 1: Identify What Gets Affected**

**Look for Direct Impacts:**
- Find all systems that directly connect to what you're changing
- List the critical pathways your change will touch
- Map out which capabilities depend on this component
- Assess how your change affects existing processes

**Look for Indirect Impacts:**
- Trace the chain reaction: what affects what affects what
- Consider the broader ecosystem consequences
- Think about how users and stakeholders will be impacted
- Project both short-term and long-term effects

**Step 2: Update All Connections**

**Fix Broken Links:**
- Update all references that point to what you changed
- Check both directions - what points to it and what it points to
- Find and repair any broken connections
- Eliminate circular references that create loops

**Synchronize Systems:**
- Update component registries and tracking systems
- Refresh relationship databases
- Update navigation and access paths
- Regenerate search indexes and discovery systems

**Step 3: Coordinate Integration**

**Align System Design:**
- Ensure your changes follow established patterns
- Verify compatibility between different systems
- Standardize data formats and communication protocols
- Coordinate security permissions and access controls

**Coordinate Workflows:**
- Update process integrations
- Align automation tools and scripts
- Integrate monitoring and tracking systems
- Synchronize documentation systems

## ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY**: Orchestrators must use Task tools for agent deployment
**AGENT FREEDOM**: Deployed agents execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob tools
**PARALLEL PATTERN**: Deploy independent agents simultaneously within single orchestrator message
**COORDINATION PATTERN**: Use sequential Task deployment for dependent operations

### TASK TOOL DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLES

**Impact Analysis**:
Task(subagent_type: "impact-analysis-specialist", description: "identify-direct-indirect-effects", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the impact-analysis-specialist agent. Map all system dependencies and trace ripple effects. DELIVERABLES: Impact analysis report operations/[conversation-id]/impact-analysis-results")

**Dependency Coordination**:
Task(subagent_type: "dependency-coordination-specialist", description: "manage-cross-references-synchronization", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the dependency-coordination-specialist agent. Update references, synchronize systems, coordinate integration. DELIVERABLES: Coordination report operations/[conversation-id]/dependency-coordination-results")

**Response Strategy**:
Task(subagent_type: "response-strategy-specialist", description: "implement-reactive-proactive-strategic", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the response-strategy-specialist agent. Implement appropriate response strategy based on impact scale. DELIVERABLES: Response strategy analysis operations/[conversation-id]/response-strategy-results")
