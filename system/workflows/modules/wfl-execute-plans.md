- Achieve progress monitoring with real-time tracking and adaptive control
- Achieve quality assurance through continuous validation and improvement cycles

### 4.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **Implementation Success**: 100% plan deliverables completed - Calculate as completed_deliverables / planned_deliverables * 100
- **Quality Achievement**: 95%+ quality standards compliance - Calculate as quality_passed_checkpoints / total_checkpoints * 100
- **Resource Efficiency**: 90%+ optimal resource utilization - Calculate as actual_resource_usage / planned_resource_allocation * 100
- **Timeline Adherence**: 95%+ milestone completion on schedule - Calculate as on_time_milestones / total_milestones * 100
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: 90%+ acceptance rate - Calculate as accepted_deliverables / total_deliverables * 100

## 5. Create Implementation Plan

**Apply Universal Planning**: Follow systematic planning methodology from [Universal Planning Workflow](wfl-plan-execution.md) to design complete execution strategy and multi-agent deployment plan.

## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration

### 6.1 Prepare for Execution

**Set Up Your Resources**
1. Assign your team - Match skills to tasks and coordinate responsibilities
2. Prepare your tools - Verify all systems and technology are ready
3. Set up your environment - Configure infrastructure and workspace
4. Check prerequisites - Confirm all dependencies are satisfied

**Plan Your Implementation**
1. Order your tasks - Determine the optimal execution sequence
2. Find parallel opportunities - Identify tasks you can run simultaneously
3. Define your milestones - Establish clear progress checkpoints
4. Set quality gates - Prepare validation points throughout execution

### 6.2 Execute Your Implementation

**Run Sequential Tasks**
1. Execute step by step - Complete each phase systematically
2. Validate at checkpoints - Verify quality at each stage
3. Monitor progress continuously - Track advancement in real time
4. Adjust when needed - Modify your plan based on results

**Coordinate Parallel Work**
1. Manage multiple workstreams - Coordinate concurrent tasks effectively
2. Optimize resource usage - Distribute capacity efficiently
3. Synchronize convergence points - Coordinate when parallel work meets
4. Maintain alignment - Keep all workstreams working toward the same goal

### 6.3 Choose Your Execution Pattern

**Use Linear Execution When:**
- Tasks depend heavily on each other
- You need strict sequence control
- Requirements are well-defined and stable

**Execute this way:**
1. Complete tasks one after another
2. Validate each step before proceeding
3. Track cumulative progress
4. Communicate at each milestone

**Use Parallel Execution When:**
- Tasks are independent
- You have multiple resources available
- Speed is critical

**Execute this way:**
1. Distribute tasks across available resources
2. Coordinate synchronization points
3. Manage shared resources carefully
4. Integrate results systematically

**Use Iterative Execution When:**
- Requirements may change
- You need frequent feedback
- Risk reduction is important

**Execute this way:**
1. Plan short cycles with clear goals
2. Incorporate feedback between cycles
3. Improve continuously based on results
4. Adapt your plan as you learn

**Use Agile Execution When:**
- Change is expected and welcomed
- Stakeholder collaboration is essential
- Working solutions matter more than documentation

**Execute this way:**
1. Work in time-boxed sprints
2. Collaborate continuously with stakeholders
3. Respond to change over following plans
4. Deliver working solutions frequently

## ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY**: Orchestrators must use Task tools for agent deployment
**AGENT FREEDOM**: Deployed agents execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob tools
**PARALLEL PATTERN**: Deploy independent agents simultaneously within single orchestrator message
**COORDINATION PATTERN**: Use sequential Task deployment for dependent operations

### TASK TOOL DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLES

**Resource Management**:
Task(subagent_type: "resource-management-specialist", description: "coordinate-team-tools-infrastructure", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the resource-management-specialist agent. Match skills to tasks, prepare systems, configure infrastructure. DELIVERABLES: Resource coordination report operations/[conversation-id]/resource-management-results")

**Execution Pattern Selection**:
Task(subagent_type: "execution-pattern-specialist", description: "select-optimal-implementation-approach", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the execution-pattern-specialist agent. Determine optimal execution pattern (Linear/Parallel/Iterative/Agile). DELIVERABLES: Execution pattern analysis operations/[conversation-id]/execution-pattern-results")

**Progress Monitoring**:
Task(subagent_type: "monitoring-specialist", description: "track-progress-quality-realtime", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the monitoring-specialist agent. Monitor progress, track quality, coordinate adjustments. DELIVERABLES: Progress monitoring report operations/[conversation-id]/monitoring-results")
