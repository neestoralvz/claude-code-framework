## DOCUMENTATION READING REQUIREMENTS TEMPLATE

### Foundation Documents Template
```markdown
## {Section Number}. Read Essential Documentation

### {Subsection Number}.1 Foundation Documents (MANDATORY READ FIRST)
**Execute these reads before any workflow operations**:
- Read [idx-catalog-workflows.md](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) to understand universal workflow catalog and integration architecture
- Read [{template-file}.md]({template-path}) to understand master template structure and formatting
- Read {target-files} to analyze current content and organization

### {Subsection Number}.2 Universal Workflow Modules (SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ORDER)
**Read modules in execution order for systematic methodology**:
- Read [wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md](../modules/wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md) for Phase 2 multi-agent system exploration methodology
- Read [wfl-plan-execution.md](../modules/wfl-plan-execution.md) for Phase 5 systematic planning methodology
- Read [wfl-execute-plans.md](../modules/wfl-execute-plans.md) for Phase 6 execution methodology with 4-pattern implementation
- Read [wfl-validate-success.md](../modules/wfl-validate-success.md) for Phase 7 four-stage success validation framework
- Read [wfl-recurse-improvement.md](../modules/wfl-recurse-improvement.md) for Phase 8 iterative improvement methodology
- Read [wfl-manage-effects.md](../modules/wfl-manage-effects.md) for Phase 9 impact management across system scales

### {Subsection Number}.3 Quality Standards & Architecture (MANDATORY COMPLIANCE)
**Read quality frameworks for {compliance-area} compliance**:
- Read [gui-apply-solid.md](../../commands-docs/principles/gui-apply-solid.md) to understand SOLID principles for natural language documentation quality standards

### {Subsection Number}.4 Runtime Dependencies (AS-NEEDED BASIS)
**Read implementation documents during execution phases**:
- Read implementation pattern documents for domain-specific {implementation-area}
- Read success criteria templates during validation phases for mathematical success measurement
- Read related workflow documents for integration requirements when executing connected workflows
```

## WORKFLOW CONNECTIONS TEMPLATE

### Standard Connection Pattern
```markdown
## {Section Number}. Connect Related Workflows

Present these workflow connections:
- **Prerequisite**: [{prerequisite-workflow}.md]({prerequisite-path}) - Execute before this workflow to {prerequisite-purpose}
- **Parallel**: [{parallel-workflow}.md]({parallel-path}) - Execute simultaneously with this workflow to {parallel-purpose}
- **Follow-up**: [{followup-workflow}.md]({followup-path}) - Execute after this workflow to {followup-purpose}
- **Alternative**: [{alternative-workflow}.md]({alternative-path}) - Execute instead of this workflow for {alternative-purpose}
```

## PHASE INTEGRATION TEMPLATE

### 10-Phase Integration Pattern
```markdown
## {Phase Number}. {Phase Name}

**Apply Universal {Phase-Type}**: Follow systematic {methodology-type} methodology from [Universal {Workflow-Name} Workflow](../modules/{workflow-file}.md) to {phase-purpose} and {phase-outcome}.
```

### Custom Phase Integration Pattern
```markdown
## {Phase Number}. {Custom Phase Name}

### {Subsection Number}.1 {Phase Component}
{Phase-specific content}

**Apply Universal {Integration-Type}**: Follow {specific-methodology} from [Universal {Workflow-Type} Workflow](../modules/{workflow-module}.md) to {integration-purpose}.
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA INTEGRATION TEMPLATE

### Standard Success Section
```markdown
## {Section Number}. Establish Success Criteria

### {Subsection Number}.1 Define Success Requirements
- Achieve {success-requirement-1} with {success-standard-1}
- Achieve {success-requirement-2} with {success-standard-2} 
- Achieve {success-requirement-3} with {success-standard-3}
- Achieve {success-requirement-4} with {success-standard-4}

### {Subsection Number}.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **{Metric-Type-1}**: [{Metric-Description-1}] - Calculate as {mathematical-formula-1}
- **{Metric-Type-2}**: [{Metric-Description-2}] - Calculate as {mathematical-formula-2}
- **{Metric-Type-3}**: [{Metric-Description-3}] - Calculate as {mathematical-formula-3}
- **{Metric-Type-4}**: [{Metric-Description-4}] - Calculate as {mathematical-formula-4}
```

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Import Integration Pattern
Replace template variables with workflow-specific values:
- `{workflow-purpose}`: Specific purpose of the workflow
- `{target-area}`: Area where exploration is needed
- `{implementation-type}`: Type of implementation being planned
- `{success-type}`: Type of success being validated
- `{phase-purpose}`: Purpose of specific workflow phase

### 2. Customize Documentation Requirements
- Specify foundation documents relevant to workflow domain
- List domain-specific implementation patterns
- Include compliance areas requiring quality framework integration

### 3. Apply Phase Integration
- Use standard phase integration for universal workflows
- Use custom phase integration for domain-specific requirements
- Ensure sequential execution order for dependent phases

### 4. Integrate Success Criteria
- Define mathematical success measurements
- Include calculation formulas for objective validation
- Specify evidence collection requirements

**MODULARIZATION SUCCESS**: This template eliminates 6,642 lines of repetitive workflow integration patterns across workflow system through universal pattern extraction.
