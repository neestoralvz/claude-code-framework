### 6.3 Agent Coordination Pattern

**COORDINATION PATTERN**: Use sequential Task deployment for dependent operations

### TASK TOOL DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLES

**Parallel Independent Tasks**:
Task(subagent_type: "planning-specialist", description: "design-solution-architecture", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the planning-specialist agent. Design comprehensive solution architecture...")
Task(subagent_type: "domain-specialist", description: "analyze-technical-requirements", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the domain-specialist agent. Analyze domain-specific technical requirements...")

**Parallel Execution Phase**:
Task(subagent_type: "validation-engineer", description: "setup-quality-gates", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the validation-engineer agent. Setup quality assurance gates...")
Task(subagent_type: "workflow-coordinator", description: "coordinate-integration", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the workflow-coordinator agent. Coordinate system integration...")

## 10. Connect Related Workflows

Present these workflow connections:
- **Prerequisite**: Command planning workflows - Execute before this workflow to establish systematic execution context
- **Parallel**: Quality assurance workflows - Execute simultaneously with this workflow to maintain quality standards
- **Follow-up**: System integration workflows - Execute after this workflow to verify complete system harmony
- **Alternative**: Custom workflow development - Execute instead of this workflow for specialized methodology requirements

### Template Integration Pattern
```yaml
template_workflow_integration:
