# Keep Improving Until You Get It Right

**Integrate Universal Workflows**: Apply systematic iterative improvement methodology through universal workflow patterns using modular design from [idx-catalog-workflows.md](idx-catalog-workflows.md) for comprehensive enhancement and failure recovery.

## 1. Define Iterative Improvement Goals

### 1.1 State Primary Objective
Iterate systematically when first attempts don't work perfectly by learning from failures and implementing better approaches through continuous improvement cycles.

### 1.2 List Specific Objectives
- Deploy failure analysis specialists to identify root causes and damage assessment
- Deploy improvement strategy specialists to plan corrective, optimization, and preventive approaches
- Deploy enhancement execution specialists to implement systematic improvements with upgraded methods
- Deploy multi-worker coordination specialists to manage parallel improvement cycles
- Deploy termination criteria specialists to determine optimal stopping points and resource limits

## 2. Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents

**Apply Universal Exploration Deployment**: Follow systematic exploration methodology from [Universal Exploration Deployment Workflow](wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md) to deploy specialized agents across improvement analysis and enhancement coordination requirements.

## 3. Read Essential Documentation

### 3.1 Foundation Documents (MANDATORY READ FIRST)
**Execute these reads before any improvement operations**:
- Read [idx-catalog-workflows.md](idx-catalog-workflows.md) to understand universal workflow catalog and integration architecture
- Read failure analysis documentation to understand root cause identification methodologies
- Read improvement strategy frameworks to establish enhancement approaches

### 3.2 Improvement Methodology Documentation (SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ORDER)
**Read documents in execution order for systematic methodology**:
- Read failure analysis resources for comprehensive problem identification and damage assessment
- Read improvement strategy patterns for corrective, optimization, and preventive approaches
- Read enhancement execution frameworks for systematic implementation with upgraded methods
- Read coordination patterns for multi-worker improvement cycles and termination criteria

## 4. Establish Success Criteria

### 4.1 Define Success Requirements

- Achieve improvement strategy implementation through effective corrective, optimization, and preventive approaches
- Achieve enhancement execution through upgraded methods and strengthened verification protocols
- Achieve optimal termination through appropriate stopping criteria and resource limit recognition

### 4.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **Improvement Success**: 95%+ iterations achieve better results than previous attempts - Calculate as improved_iterations / total_iterations * 100
- **Problem Resolution**: 100% identified root causes addressed effectively - Calculate as resolved_causes / identified_causes * 100
- **Quality Enhancement**: 90%+ quality standard elevation through iterations - Calculate as quality_improvements / iteration_cycles * 100
- **Resource Efficiency**: 85%+ optimal resource utilization across improvement cycles - Calculate as efficient_resource_usage / total_resource_allocation * 100
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: 95%+ acceptance rate for improved results - Calculate as accepted_improvements / total_improvements * 100

## 5. Create Implementation Plan

**Apply Universal Planning**: Follow systematic planning methodology from [Universal Planning Workflow](wfl-plan-execution.md) to design complete iterative improvement strategy and multi-agent deployment plan.

## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration

### 6.1 When to Try Again

**Start Another Round When Things Fail**
- Your results don't meet the success requirements you set
- Quality checks reveal problems that need fixing
- The user rejects your work or asks for changes
- Different parts of the system don't work together properly

**Start Another Round When You Can Do Better**
- You see ways to make performance faster or smoother
- New requirements emerge that expand the scope
- You realize you can achieve higher quality standards
- You discover better methods while working

### 6.2 How to Analyze What Went Wrong

**Examine the Failure Thoroughly**
- Find the root cause of what actually broke
- Measure how much damage the failure caused
- Check what resources you still have available
- Calculate how this affects your timeline

**Plan Your Improvement Strategy**
- List exactly what needs to be fixed or enhanced
- Design a better approach to solve the problem
- Redistribute your time and resources more effectively
- Set clearer, more specific success measurements

### 6.3 How to Execute Your Next Attempt

**Prepare for the Improved Round**
- Apply everything you learned from the previous attempt
- Upgrade your methods based on what you discovered
- Use your resources more efficiently this time
- Strengthen how you verify success along the way

**Execute the Enhanced Solution**
- Make improvements step by step in a systematic way
- Add stronger checkpoints to catch problems early
- Coordinate better between different parts of the system
- Track your progress more carefully throughout

## ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY**: Orchestrators must use Task tools for agent deployment
**AGENT FREEDOM**: Deployed agents execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob tools
**PARALLEL PATTERN**: Deploy independent agents simultaneously within single orchestrator message
**COORDINATION PATTERN**: Use sequential Task deployment for dependent operations

### TASK TOOL DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLES

**Failure Analysis**:
Task(subagent_type: "failure-analysis-specialist", description: "identify-root-causes-damage-assessment", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the failure-analysis-specialist agent. Find root causes, measure damage, assess resources, calculate timeline impact. DELIVERABLES: Failure analysis report operations/[conversation-id]/failure-analysis-results")

**Improvement Strategy**:
Task(subagent_type: "improvement-strategy-specialist", description: "plan-corrective-optimization-preventive", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the improvement-strategy-specialist agent. Design better approach, redistribute resources, set clearer measurements. DELIVERABLES: Improvement strategy operations/[conversation-id]/improvement-strategy-results")

**Enhancement Execution**:
Task(subagent_type: "enhancement-execution-specialist", description: "implement-upgraded-methods", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the enhancement-execution-specialist agent. Apply learned insights, upgrade methods, strengthen verification. DELIVERABLES: Enhancement execution report operations/[conversation-id]/enhancement-execution-results")

## 7. Validate Complete Success

**Apply Universal Validation**: Follow four-gate validation methodology from [Universal Validation Workflow](wfl-validate-success.md) to verify improvement success and ensure quality standards.

### 7.1 Three Types of Improvement Rounds
