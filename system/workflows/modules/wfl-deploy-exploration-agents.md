# Deploy Objective-Focused Exploration Agents

**Integrate Universal Workflows**: Apply systematic exploration methodology through universal workflow patterns using modular design from [idx-catalog-workflows.md](idx-catalog-workflows.md) for comprehensive agent deployment coordination.

## 1. Define Objective-Focused Exploration Goals

### 1.1 State Primary Objective
Deploy objective-focused exploration agents based on specific requirements to gather only necessary information for objective achievement.

### 1.2 List Specific Objectives
- Deploy objective-analysis specialists to analyze ONLY system areas required for stated objectives
- Deploy dependency specialists to map ONLY dependencies that could block objective achievement
- Deploy risk-analysis specialists to identify ONLY risks that could prevent objective completion
- Deploy integration specialists to study ONLY integration points required for objective success
- Deploy targeted exploration agents to eliminate general system knowledge gathering

## 2. Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents

**Apply Universal Exploration Deployment**: Follow systematic exploration methodology from [Universal Exploration Deployment Workflow](idx-catalog-workflows.md) to deploy specialized agents across objective-focused information requirements.

### 2.1 Analyze Objective Requirements
Execute objective-specific exploration analysis:
- Identify ONLY the information required to achieve stated objectives
- Map direct dependencies needed for objective completion
- Eliminate exploratory activities that don't contribute to objective success
- Define minimum viable exploration scope for maximum efficiency

### 2.2 Select Targeted Exploration Areas
Choose exploration areas based on objective necessity:
- **Objective-Critical**: Areas that directly enable objective achievement
- **Dependency-Required**: Dependencies that block objective completion without exploration
- **Risk-Mitigation**: Areas where unknown factors could cause objective failure
- **EXCLUDE**: General system knowledge that doesn't serve specific objectives

## 3. Read Essential Documentation

### 3.1 Foundation Documents (MANDATORY READ FIRST)
**Execute these reads before any exploration operations**:
- Read [idx-catalog-workflows.md](idx-catalog-workflows.md) to understand universal workflow catalog and integration architecture
- Read objective requirements documentation to analyze exploration scope
- Read system architecture documents relevant to stated objectives

### 3.2 Objective-Focused Documentation (SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ORDER)
**Read documents in execution order for systematic methodology**:
- Read objective-specific system documentation for targeted exploration
- Read dependency mapping resources for objective-blocking analysis
- Read risk assessment frameworks for objective-threat identification
- Read integration patterns for objective-required coordination points

## 4. Establish Success Criteria

### 4.1 Define Success Requirements
- Achieve objective-sufficient information gathering (not comprehensive coverage)
- Achieve all objective-critical dependencies and risks identification and analysis
- Achieve objective-blocking information gaps elimination
- Achieve readiness for objective-focused implementation confirmation

### 4.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **Objective Relevance**: 90%+ objective-relevant findings - Calculate as objective_relevant_findings / total_findings * 100
- **Exploration Efficiency**: 85%+ objective-achieving information - Calculate as objective_achieving_information / total_explored_information * 100
- **Speed to Sufficiency**: 50% reduction from comprehensive exploration - Calculate as (comprehensive_time - targeted_time) / comprehensive_time * 100
- **Implementation Readiness**: 100% objectives achievable with gathered information - Calculate as achievable_objectives / total_objectives * 100

## 5. Create Implementation Plan

**Apply Universal Planning**: Follow systematic planning methodology from [Universal Planning Workflow](wfl-plan-execution.md) to design complete objective-focused exploration strategy and multi-agent deployment plan.

## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Apply Universal Execution**: Follow systematic implementation methodology from [Universal Execution Workflow](wfl-execute-plans.md) to deliver exploration through coordinated multi-agent deployment.

### 6.1 Send Out Your Investigation Teams

## ORCHESTRATOR COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS

**MANDATORY**: Orchestrators must use Task tools for agent deployment
**AGENT FREEDOM**: Deployed agents execute directly with Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob tools
**PARALLEL PATTERN**: Deploy independent agents simultaneously within single orchestrator message
**COORDINATION PATTERN**: Use sequential Task deployment for dependent operations

### COORDINATION REQUIREMENT: Deploy objective-focused agents based on exploration necessity

**SELECTIVE DEPLOYMENT PATTERN**: Deploy only agents required for specific objectives

**Objective-Critical Analysis** (Deploy when objectives require system understanding):
Task(subagent_type: "objective-analysis-specialist", description: "analyze-objective-requirements", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the objective-analysis-specialist agent. Execute Targeted Exploration: Analyze ONLY system areas required to achieve stated objectives. Focus on objective-critical information. DELIVERABLES: Objective-focused analysis operations/[conversation-id]/objective-analysis-results")

**Dependency Analysis** (Deploy when objectives have unknown dependencies):
Task(subagent_type: "dependency-specialist", description: "map-objective-dependencies", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the dependency-specialist agent. Execute Targeted Exploration: Map ONLY dependencies that could block objective achievement. Exclude general system mapping. DELIVERABLES: Objective dependency map operations/[conversation-id]/dependency-analysis-results")

**Risk Assessment** (Deploy when objectives face unknown risks):
Task(subagent_type: "risk-analysis-specialist", description: "assess-objective-risks", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the risk-analysis-specialist agent. Execute Targeted Exploration: Identify ONLY risks that could prevent objective completion. Focus on objective-specific risks. DELIVERABLES: Risk assessment operations/[conversation-id]/risk-analysis-results")

**Integration Analysis** (Deploy ONLY when objectives require cross-system coordination):
Task(subagent_type: "integration-specialist", description: "analyze-objective-integration", prompt: "I am the orchestrator and you are the integration-specialist agent. Execute Targeted Exploration: Study ONLY integration points required for objective success. Exclude general system interactions. DELIVERABLES: Integration analysis operations/[conversation-id]/integration-analysis-results")

**DEPLOYMENT RULE**: Deploy agents selectively based on objective requirements, not comprehensively

### 6.2 Coordinate Objective-Focused Information Sharing

Coordinate information sharing based on objective necessity:
- Share findings ONLY when they impact other agents' objective-related work
- Focus coordination on objective-critical intersections
- Eliminate general information sharing that doesn't serve objectives
- Prioritize speed of objective achievement over comprehensive coverage

## 7. Validate Complete Success

**Apply Universal Validation**: Follow four-gate validation methodology from [Universal Validation Workflow](wfl-validate-success.md) to verify objective-focused exploration success and ensure quality standards.

### 7.1 Validate Objective-Sufficient Exploration

Verify exploration adequacy for objective completion:
- Confirm SUFFICIENT information gathered to achieve stated objectives
- Assess objective completion probability based on gathered information
- Identify any objective-blocking information gaps requiring additional exploration
- Validate readiness for objective-focused implementation

## 8. Iterate Until Perfect Results

**Apply Universal Recursion**: Follow systematic iteration methodology from [Universal Recursion Workflow](wfl-recurse-improvement.md) to achieve continuous improvement and complete exploration success.

## 9. Manage System-Wide Impact

**Apply Universal Ripple Effect**: Follow systematic impact management from [Universal Ripple Effect Workflow](wfl-manage-effects.md) to coordinate cross-system changes and exploration dependencies.

## 10. Connect Related Workflows

Present these workflow connections:
- **Prerequisite**: Objective definition workflows - Execute before this workflow to establish clear exploration scope
- **Parallel**: Information validation workflows - Execute simultaneously with this workflow to verify exploration quality
- **Follow-up**: Implementation planning workflows - Execute after this workflow to utilize gathered information
- **Alternative**: Comprehensive system exploration - Execute instead of this workflow for complete system analysis requirements

### 10.1 Package Objective-Focused Insights

Package discoveries focused on objective achievement:
- Summarize findings directly relevant to stated objectives
- Highlight objective-critical dependencies and risks identified
- Present information architecture supporting objective completion
- Exclude exploratory findings that don't contribute to objective success

### 10.2 Objective-Focused Success Criteria

**Completion Requirements**
- SUFFICIENT information gathered to achieve stated objectives (not comprehensive coverage)
- All objective-critical dependencies and risks identified and analyzed
- Objective-blocking information gaps eliminated
- Readiness for objective-focused implementation confirmed

**Efficiency Standards**
- **Objective Relevance**: Count objective-relevant findings divided by total findings, multiply by 100 (aim for 90%+)
- **Exploration Efficiency**: Count objective-achieving information divided by total explored information, multiply by 100 (aim for 85%+)
- **Speed to Sufficiency**: Minimize time from exploration start to objective-sufficient information (target: 50% reduction from comprehensive exploration)
- **Implementation Readiness**: Count objectives achievable with gathered information divided by total objectives, multiply by 100 (aim for 100%)
