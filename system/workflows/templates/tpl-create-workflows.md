# Master Workflow Template Structure

**Template Version**: 1.0.0  
**Integration**: Universal Workflow Modules  
**Compliance**: SOLID Principles for Natural Language Documentation

## Template Structure Framework

### 1. Workflow Header
```markdown
# [Workflow Name]

**Integrate Universal Workflows**: Use all workflow modules from the [Universal Workflows Index](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) for complete systematic [workflow type] execution.
```

### 2. Phase Definitions (10-Phase Structure)
```markdown
## 1. Define [Workflow Type] Goals
## 2. Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents  
## 3. Read Essential Documentation
## 4. Establish Success Criteria
## 5. Create Implementation Plan
## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration
## 7. Validate Complete Success
## 8. Iterate Until Perfect Results
## 9. Manage System-Wide Impact
## 10. Connect Related Workflows
```

### 3. Universal Module Integration References
```markdown
### 3.1 Foundation Documents (MANDATORY READ FIRST)
- Read [idx-catalog-workflows.md](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) to understand universal workflow catalog and integration architecture

### 3.2 Universal Workflow Modules (SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION ORDER)
- Read [wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md](../modules/wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md) for Phase 2 multi-agent system exploration methodology
- Read [wfl-plan-execution.md](../modules/wfl-plan-execution.md) for Phase 5 systematic planning methodology
- Read [wfl-execute-plans.md](../modules/wfl-execute-plans.md) for Phase 6 execution methodology with 4-pattern implementation
- Read [wfl-validate-success.md](../modules/wfl-validate-success.md) for Phase 7 four-stage success validation framework
- Read [wfl-recurse-improvement.md](../modules/wfl-recurse-improvement.md) for Phase 8 iterative improvement methodology
- Read [wfl-manage-effects.md](../modules/wfl-manage-effects.md) for Phase 9 impact management across system scales
```

### 4. Agent Deployment Patterns
```markdown
### Parallel Agent Deployment Requirement
**CRITICAL FRAMEWORK COMPLIANCE**: All agent deployments must use Task tools executed in parallel within the same message when operations are independent. This ensures optimal resource utilization and adherence to Claude Code Framework orchestrator requirements.
```

### 5. Quality Standards Integration
```markdown
### Quality Standards & Architecture (MANDATORY COMPLIANCE)
**Read quality frameworks for workflow compliance**:
- Read [gui-apply-solid.md](../../commands-docs/principles/gui-apply-solid.md) to understand SOLID principles for natural language documentation quality standards
```

### 6. Success Criteria Framework
```markdown
### Success Criteria Definition
**Mathematical Validation Requirements**:
- Define measurable completion requirements with mathematical metrics
- Apply four-gate validation methodology
- Use universal recursion workflow for continuous improvement until 100% success
```

### 7. Workflow Integration Points
```markdown
### Integration and Orchestration
**Connect Related Workflows**: Link prerequisites, parallel, and follow-up workflows for complete systematic execution
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Imperative Tone Requirements
- Use active voice and direct commands
- Begin sections with action verbs (Deploy, Execute, Validate, etc.)
- Maintain consistent command structure throughout

### Cross-Reference Standards
- All module references use relative paths from current location
- Universal workflow modules referenced from ../modules/
- Commands docs referenced from ../../commands-docs/
- Quality frameworks mandatory for compliance validation

### Parallel Execution Patterns
- Deploy multiple agents via Task tools in single message when operations are independent
- Use systematic exploration methodology from universal modules
- Apply four-stage validation framework consistently

### Evidence Storage Requirements
- Store all execution results in operations/{conversation-id}/
- Maintain mathematical validation evidence
- Document progressive thinking rationale for complexity levels
