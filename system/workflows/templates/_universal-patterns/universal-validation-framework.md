## Universal Mathematical Success Criteria Framework

### Standard Calculation Templates
```yaml
universal_success_metrics:
  completion_rate:
    calculation: "delivered_outputs / required_outputs * 100"
    target: "100%"
    
  quality_score:
    calculation: "passed_quality_checks / total_quality_checks * 100"
    target: "95%+"
    
  compliance_rate:
    calculation: "compliant_standards / total_standards * 100"  
    target: "100%"
    
  integration_success:
    calculation: "passed_integrations / total_integrations * 100"
    target: "100%"
    
  evidence_quality:
    calculation: "complete_evidence_items / total_evidence_requirements * 100"
    target: "95%+"
```

### Universal Evidence Collection Framework
```markdown
### Required Evidence Types
**Automated Evidence:**
- Test execution results with pass/fail metrics
- Performance benchmarking data with comparative analysis
- Security scanning reports with vulnerability assessments  
- Integration testing outcomes with system compatibility verification

**Manual Evidence:**  
- Expert review assessments with quality scoring
- User acceptance confirmations with satisfaction metrics
- Peer validation reports with independent verification
- Stakeholder approval documentation with acceptance criteria

**System Evidence:**
- Deployment verification logs with operational status
- Monitoring system confirmations with health metrics
- Backup and recovery testing with restoration verification
- Cross-system integration validation with connectivity testing

## Universal Pattern Authority
This universal validation framework pattern must be applied to Phase 7 of all workflows requiring systematic success verification to ensure:
- 100% four-stage validation completion
- 100% mathematical success criteria verification  
- 95%+ evidence collection completeness
- 100% validation accuracy achievement

**Integration Requirement**: All workflows requiring success validation must import this universal pattern for comprehensive quality assurance and evidence-based verification compliance.
