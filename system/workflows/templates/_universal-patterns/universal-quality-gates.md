Execute Quality Gate Enforcement: Apply universal quality gate requirements for {{PHASE_NAME}} with mathematical compliance verification. DELIVERABLES: Quality gate status report operations/[conversation-id]/quality-gate-{{PHASE}}-results")

## Universal Deviation Detection System

### Automated Deviation Detection Framework
```markdown
### Quality Deviation Indicators
**Performance Deviations:**
- Execution time exceeding benchmarks by >15%
- Resource utilization above planned thresholds by >20%
- Quality metrics falling below targets by >5%
- Integration failures exceeding tolerance of >2%

**Process Deviations:**
- Workflow step omissions or unauthorized modifications
- Documentation gaps exceeding 10% of requirements  
- Standard compliance violations in any category
- Communication protocol deviations from established patterns

**Output Deviations:**
- Deliverable completeness below 100% requirement satisfaction
- Quality assessment scores below minimum thresholds
- Stakeholder acceptance criteria unmet in any area
- System integration compatibility failures

### Automatic Correction Triggers
```yaml
deviation_correction_system:
  performance_corrections:
    trigger_threshold: "15% benchmark deviation"
    correction_action: "Resource reallocation + Process optimization"
    
  process_corrections:
    trigger_threshold: "Any step omission or standard violation"
    correction_action: "Immediate remediation + Enhanced monitoring"
    
  output_corrections:
    trigger_threshold: "Quality score below 95% or incomplete deliverable"
    correction_action: "Quality enhancement + Stakeholder re-engagement"
    
  integration_corrections:
    trigger_threshold: "Any compatibility failure or dependency break"
    correction_action: "Integration repair + System verification"
```
```

- 100% quality gate pass rate achievement
- 95%+ deviation detection accuracy
- 100% correction effectiveness
- 100% quality preservation maintenance
- 10%+ continuous improvement achievement

**Integration Requirement**: All workflows requiring quality assurance must import this universal pattern for systematic quality gate enforcement and deviation detection compliance.
