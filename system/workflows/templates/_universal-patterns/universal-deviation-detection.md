## Universal Deviation Detection Architecture

### Real-Time Monitoring Framework
```markdown
### Multi-Dimensional Deviation Detection
**Performance Deviation Monitoring:**
- Execution time variance tracking - Calculate as (actual_time - planned_time) / planned_time * 100 (Alert: >15%)
- Resource utilization anomalies - Calculate as (actual_resources - planned_resources) / planned_resources * 100 (Alert: >20%)  
- Throughput degradation analysis - Calculate as (expected_throughput - actual_throughput) / expected_throughput * 100 (Alert: >10%)
- Quality metric deterioration - Calculate as (baseline_quality - current_quality) / baseline_quality * 100 (Alert: >5%)

**Process Deviation Monitoring:**
- Workflow sequence adherence - Calculate as followed_steps / required_steps * 100 (Alert: <100%)
- Standard compliance tracking - Calculate as compliant_activities / total_activities * 100 (Alert: <95%)
- Documentation completeness monitoring - Calculate as documented_items / required_documentation * 100 (Alert: <90%)
- Communication protocol adherence - Calculate as protocol_compliant_communications / total_communications * 100 (Alert: <95%)

**Output Deviation Monitoring:**  
- Deliverable quality variance - Calculate as (actual_quality - expected_quality) / expected_quality * 100 (Alert: <-5%)
- Completeness gap detection - Calculate as delivered_components / required_components * 100 (Alert: <100%)

```

### Predictive Deviation Analysis System
```markdown
### Trend-Based Prediction Framework
**Leading Indicator Analysis:**
```yaml
predictive_deviation_indicators:
  performance_predictors:
    resource_consumption_trend: "Alert if 3-period upward trend >10%"
    execution_time_pattern: "Alert if 2-period increase >8%"
    quality_degradation_slope: "Alert if downward trend >3% per period"
    
  process_predictors:
    compliance_drift: "Alert if 2-period decline in adherence >2%"
    documentation_lag: "Alert if documentation gap increasing >5%"
    communication_degradation: "Alert if protocol deviations increasing"
    
  output_predictors:
    quality_trajectory: "Alert if quality trend indicates <95% target"
    completeness_risk: "Alert if delivery pace indicates gaps"
    integration_risk: "Alert if compatibility tests show degradation"
```

**Early Warning System:**
- 3-period trend analysis for performance degradation prediction
- 2-period pattern recognition for process deviation forecasting
- Single-period anomaly detection for immediate quality risks
- Cross-metric correlation analysis for systemic issue prediction
```

### Automatic Correction System Architecture

## Universal Threshold Management System

### Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
```markdown
### Adaptive Threshold Framework
```yaml
threshold_management_system:
  performance_thresholds:
    execution_time:
      initial_threshold: "15%"
      adjustment_factor: "Historical performance + 2 standard deviations"
      minimum_threshold: "10%"
      maximum_threshold: "25%"
      
    resource_utilization:
      initial_threshold: "20%" 
      adjustment_factor: "Capacity planning + seasonal variations"
      minimum_threshold: "15%"
      maximum_threshold: "30%"
      
  quality_thresholds:
    output_quality:
      initial_threshold: "5%"
      adjustment_factor: "Stakeholder expectations + historical quality"
      minimum_threshold: "2%"
      maximum_threshold: "10%"
      
    process_compliance:
      initial_threshold: "5%"
      adjustment_factor: "Regulatory requirements + best practices"
      minimum_threshold: "0%"
      maximum_threshold: "5%"
```

### Mathematical Threshold Calculations
- **Performance Baseline**: Calculate as average(last_10_periods) + 2 * standard_deviation(last_10_periods)  
- **Quality Baseline**: Calculate as minimum(stakeholder_expectations, historical_maximum * 0.95)
- **Process Baseline**: Calculate as maximum(regulatory_minimum, best_practice_standard * 1.05)
- **Integration Baseline**: Calculate as system_compatibility_requirements * 1.00 (no tolerance)
