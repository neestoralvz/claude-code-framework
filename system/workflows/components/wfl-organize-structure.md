# Organize Directory Structure Workflow

**Integrate Universal Workflows**: Use all workflow modules from the [Universal Workflows Index](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) for complete systematic directory organization.

## 1. Define Directory Organization Goals

### 1.1 State Primary Objective
Systematically organize and structure the commands-docs directory with clear hierarchical logic, improved navigation, and logical file grouping.

### 1.2 List Specific Objectives
- Deploy filesystem management agents to create logical directory categorization
- Deploy file migration specialists to move files to appropriate hierarchical locations
- Deploy cross-reference maintenance agents to update navigation integrity
- Deploy validation agents to verify improved organizational effectiveness

## 2. Deploy Multi-System Exploration Agents

**Apply Universal Exploration Deployment**: Follow systematic exploration methodology from [Universal Exploration Deployment Workflow](../modules/wfl-deploy-exploration-agents.md) to deploy specialized agents across directory structure and file organization requirements.

## 3. Read Essential Documentation

Read these documents before executing:
- Read [mtx-reference-commands.md](../../../reference/mtx-reference-commands.md) to understand command organization principles
- Read [mtx-discover-commands.md](../../../navigation/mtx-discover-commands.md) to verify navigation requirements
- Read [index.md](../../../index.md) to learn current navigation patterns

## 4. Establish Success Criteria

### 4.1 Define Success Requirements
- Achieve logical grouping by function and purpose with clear directory hierarchy
- Achieve improved file discoverability with reduced navigation complexity
- Achieve all cross-references updated and functional with no broken links

### 4.2 Set Success Metrics
Measure success using these calculations:
- **Efficiency**: [File location time reduced by 60%] - Calculate as (baseline_time - new_time) / baseline_time * 100
- **Quality**: [100% functional cross-references and navigation links] - Calculate as functional_links / total_links * 100
- **Completeness**: [All files organized in appropriate hierarchical categories] - Calculate as organized_files / total_files * 100

## 5. Create Implementation Plan

**Apply Universal Planning**: Follow systematic planning methodology from [Universal Planning Workflow](../modules/wfl-plan-execution.md) to design complete directory organization strategy and multi-agent deployment plan.

## 6. Deploy Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Apply Universal Execution**: Follow systematic implementation methodology from [Universal Execution Workflow](../modules/wfl-execute-plans.md) to deliver directory organization through coordinated multi-agent deployment.

### 6.1 Directory Structure Creation - Sequential
Deploy file system management agents via Task tools:

Task(
  subagent_type: "filesystem-management-specialist",
  description: "Create hierarchical directory structure",
  prompt: "Execute Required Exploration: Analyze current commands-docs structure
          Read Required Documentation: Review organize-structure.md requirements
          Execute: Create core/, navigation/, reference/, templates/, principles/, workflows/
          DELIVERABLES:
          - Directory validation: commands-docs/[directories]
          - Results: operations/[conversation-id]/directory-creation-results"
)
**COORDINATION**: Sequential execution

### 6.2 File Analysis and Categories - Parallel
Deploy content analysis agents via Task tools:

Task(
  subagent_type: "content-analysis-specialist", 
  description: "Analyze and categorize existing files",
  prompt: "Execute Required Exploration: Scan commands-docs files for categorization
          Read Required Documentation: Review file organization principles
          Execute: Identify core system, navigation, and reference materials
          DELIVERABLES:
          - File categorization: commands-docs/file-categories.json
          - Results: operations/[conversation-id]/file-analysis-results"
)
**COORDINATION**: Parallel execution

### 6.3 File Migration Execution - Sequential
Deploy file migration agents via Task tools:

Task(
  subagent_type: "file-migration-specialist",
  description: "Migrate files to organized directories",
  prompt: "Execute Required Exploration: Review file categorization results
          Read Required Documentation: Verify target directory structure
          Execute: Systematically move files to designated hierarchical locations
          DELIVERABLES:
          - Migration log: commands-docs/migration-log.json
          - Results: operations/[conversation-id]/file-migration-results"
)
**COORDINATION**: Sequential execution

### 6.4 Cross-Reference Updates - Parallel
Deploy cross-reference maintenance agents via Task tools:

Task(
  subagent_type: "cross-reference-specialist",
  description: "Update links for new file locations",
  prompt: "Execute Required Exploration: Identify all cross-references and links
          Read Required Documentation: Review link integrity requirements
          Execute: Update navigation breadcrumbs and internal references
          DELIVERABLES:
          - Updated references: commands-docs/[updated-files]
          - Results: operations/[conversation-id]/cross-reference-results"
)
**COORDINATION**: Parallel execution

## 7. Validate Complete Success

**Apply Universal Validation**: Follow four-gate validation methodology from [Universal Validation Workflow](../modules/wfl-validate-success.md) to verify directory organization success and ensure quality standards.

## 8. Iterate Until Perfect Results

**Apply Universal Recursion**: Follow systematic iteration methodology from [Universal Recursion Workflow](../modules/wfl-recurse-improvement.md) to achieve continuous improvement and complete directory organization success.

## 9. Manage System-Wide Impact

**Apply Universal Ripple Effect**: Follow systematic impact management from [Universal Ripple Effect Workflow](../modules/wfl-manage-effects.md) to coordinate cross-system changes and directory organization dependencies.

## 10. Connect Related Workflows

Present these workflow connections:
- **Prerequisite**: [filesystem-preparation.md](../filesystem-preparation.md) - Execute before this workflow to prepare system for reorganization
- **Parallel**: [wfl-apply-templates.md](wfl-apply-templates.md) - Execute simultaneously with this workflow to standardize workflow formatting
- **Follow-up**: [wfl-maintain-system.md](wfl-maintain-system.md) - Execute after this workflow to maintain system configuration
- **Alternative**: [idx-catalog-workflows.md](../modules/idx-catalog-workflows.md) - Execute instead of this workflow for comprehensive workflow cataloging
