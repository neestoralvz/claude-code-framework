# Oversized Files Violating Simplicity Principle

## Problem Statement

⏺ **Principle**: This ticket addresses [simplicity.md](../../principles/simplicity.md) violations by reducing file complexity that compromises maintainability and [engineering.md](../../principles/engineering.md) by enforcing size standards.

Multiple files exceed the 500-line complexity limit established by simplicity principles, making them difficult to maintain and violating system standards.

## Impact Analysis

### Violating Files
1. **TICKET_METHODOLOGY.md** (393 lines) - Approaching limit
2. **claude-md-templates.md** (355 lines) - Approaching limit  
3. **create-ticket.md** (348 lines) - Complex command
4. **formatting.md** (333 lines) - Principle file
5. **modularize.md** (327 lines) - Complex command
6. **forbidden-validation.md** (323 lines) - Component file

### User Experience Impact
- Difficult to navigate and understand
- Maintenance overhead increased
- Cognitive load excessive
- Principle violations undermine credibility

## Root Cause

Files grew organically without:
1. Modular decomposition
2. Component extraction
3. Size monitoring
4. Refactoring discipline

## Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Analyze and Plan (1 hour)
1. **Audit each file** for modularization opportunities
2. **Identify extractable components** 
3. **Plan decomposition strategy**

### Phase 2: TICKET_METHODOLOGY.md (1.5 hours)
1. **Extract sections into components**
2. **Create focused methodology core**
3. **Link to detailed components**

### Phase 3: claude-md-templates.md (1.5 hours)
1. **Split templates by category**
2. **Create template index**
3. **Maintain component references**

### Phase 4: Commands (2 hours)
1. **Extract common command patterns**
2. **Create shared command components**
3. **Simplify core command logic**

### Phase 5: Validation and Cleanup (1 hour)
1. **Verify all links work**
2. **Test functionality preserved**
3. **Update navigation and references**

## Success Criteria

- [x] All files under 300 lines (safe buffer)
- [x] Functionality fully preserved
- [x] Navigation links updated
- [x] Components properly extracted
- [x] Documentation coherence maintained
- [x] No broken references introduced
- [x] Simplicity principle compliance achieved

## Implementation Strategy

**Modularization**: Extract reusable patterns into components
**Component References**: Use includes and links
**Navigation**: Maintain access to full information
**Testing**: Verify functionality at each step

## Validation

```bash
# Check file sizes
find docs/ commands/ -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -nr

# Verify no files exceed 300 lines
find docs/ commands/ -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '$1 > 300'

# Test navigation integrity
grep -r "\.md)" . | grep -v ".jsonl" | head -20
```
