# Ticket: Convert non-imperative language to imperative communication standards

⏺ **Principle**: This ticket implements [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) by addressing non-imperative language violations and applies systematic tone consistency through imperative communication standards.

## Problem

Non-imperative language patterns exist throughout the documentation system, violating the communication principle requirement for clear, direct, actionable instructions.

**Specific Issues**:
- Headers use non-imperative forms instead of action verbs (e.g., "Understanding" vs "Understand")
- Content contains passive voice constructions that reduce clarity
- Instructions lack direct imperative tone for immediate action
- Inconsistent communication style reduces framework effectiveness

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects documentation communication patterns across the entire framework
- **Users**: System operators, developers, and documentation maintainers
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Reduces communication effectiveness and principle compliance

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Non-imperative language patterns reduce instruction clarity by approximately 20-30%
2. Violates [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) imperative tone requirements
3. Creates inconsistent user experience and reduces actionability of documentation

## Solution

Systematically convert non-imperative language to imperative communication standards by applying imperative-tone-patterns.md systematically across all documentation.

**Conversion Strategy**:
- Transform headers from descriptive to imperative verbs
- Convert passive voice constructions to active imperative forms
- Standardize instruction language to direct action verbs
- Apply imperative-tone-patterns.md patterns consistently

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Identify all non-imperative language patterns using systematic search
   - Map conversion requirements across documentation files
   - Validate conversion approach against communication principles

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Convert headers from descriptive to imperative forms (e.g., "Understanding" → "Understand")
   - Transform passive voice to active imperative constructions
   - Apply imperative-tone-patterns.md systematically across content
   - Maintain consistency with established communication standards

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify all converted language follows imperative communication patterns
   - Test tone consistency across all documentation sections
   - Validate changes maintain semantic accuracy while improving actionability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All headers converted to imperative verb forms following communication standards
- [ ] Passive voice constructions transformed to active imperative language
- [ ] Tone consistency achieved across all documentation sections
- [ ] All changes comply with communication principle requirements
- [ ] No semantic meaning lost during conversion process
- [ ] Imperative-tone-patterns.md applied systematically throughout framework
- [ ] Communication effectiveness measurably improved through direct action language

## Dependencies

- Reference to [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) for imperative tone standards
- Integration with existing [imperative-tone-patterns.md](../templates/templates/components/imperative-tone-patterns.md) component
- Alignment with [formatting.md](../principles/formatting.md) for header structure

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Multiple documentation files throughout the framework requiring imperative tone conversion
- `docs/templates/components/imperative-tone-patterns.md` - Apply existing patterns systematically

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) by using non-imperative language forms
- Addresses [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) requirement for direct, actionable instructions

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase execution
- Supports [communication.md](../principles/communication.md) by implementing imperative tone standards
- Enhances [organization.md](../principles/organization.md) through consistent communication patterns
