# Ticket: Extract Navigation Breadcrumb Patterns into Reusable Component

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) by extracting repeated navigation breadcrumb patterns into reusable components for improved maintainability.

## Problem

Navigation breadcrumb patterns are duplicated across numerous files throughout the framework, creating maintenance overhead and inconsistency in navigation experience.

**Specific Issues**:
- Inconsistent breadcrumb formatting and structure across documents
- Manual maintenance of breadcrumb links leads to broken navigation
- Duplicated breadcrumb patterns violate DRY principle
- No standardized navigation hierarchy enforcement

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects framework navigation consistency and maintenance efficiency
- **Users**: All framework users relying on document navigation
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Creates navigation inconsistency and maintenance burden

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Inconsistent breadcrumb implementations create poor user navigation experience
2. Manual breadcrumb maintenance leads to outdated and broken links
3. Duplicated patterns create unnecessary maintenance overhead

## Solution

Extract navigation breadcrumb patterns into a centralized, reusable component with automated generation and standardized formatting across the framework.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze existing breadcrumb patterns to identify standardizable structures
   - Design automated breadcrumb generation based on file hierarchy
   - Map files requiring breadcrumb standardization

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Create centralized navigation breadcrumb component
   - Implement automated breadcrumb generation logic
   - Replace manual breadcrumbs with component references
   - Establish breadcrumb validation system

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify all breadcrumbs maintain accurate navigation after component extraction
   - Test automated generation across different document types
   - Validate improved navigation consistency

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Centralized navigation breadcrumb component created and standardized
- [ ] Automated breadcrumb generation system implemented
- [ ] Manual breadcrumb patterns replaced with component references
- [ ] Validation system established for breadcrumb accuracy
- [ ] Navigation consistency improved across framework

## Dependencies

- Reference to [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) for component extraction patterns
- Reference to [formatting.md](../../principles/formatting.md) for navigation standards

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `docs/templates/components/navigation-breadcrumb-component.md` - Central breadcrumb component
- `docs/templates/components/breadcrumb-generator.md` - Automated generation logic
- Various files across commands/, agents/, docs/ directories for component integration

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [organization.md](../../principles/organization.md) through modular component design
- Supports [formatting.md](../../principles/formatting.md) by standardizing navigation patterns
