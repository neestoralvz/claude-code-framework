# COMPONENT EXTRACTION: Large File Modularization Opportunities

**AUTO-GENERATED TICKET** by system-auditor during comprehensive audit

## Problem Description

Multiple files exceed optimal size limits and contain extractable components that could be modularized for better maintainability and reusability.

## Extraction Opportunities Identified

### High Priority (>800 lines)
1. **business-analyst.md** (857 lines) - Business process components
2. **agent-orchestration-framework.md** (850 lines) - Orchestration patterns
3. **COMMAND_CONSOLIDATION_SPECIFICATION.md** (818 lines) - Command patterns

### Medium Priority (600-800 lines)
4. **product-manager.md** (605 lines) - Product strategy components
5. **technical-writer.md** (575 lines) - Documentation patterns
6. **validation.md** (545 lines) - Validation frameworks

## Impact Assessment
- Improves code maintainability and readability
- Enables component reuse across system
- Reduces cognitive load for developers
- Supports modular architecture principles

## Resolution Strategy
1. Analyze each file for extractable components
2. Create modular component structure
3. Extract reusable patterns and frameworks
4. Update cross-references and navigation
5. Validate functionality preservation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All files >800 lines reduced to manageable size
- [ ] Extractable components identified and modularized
- [ ] Component reusability implemented
- [ ] Cross-references updated correctly
- [ ] No functionality lost in extraction process

## Priority Justification
**MEDIUM** - Improves maintainability but not blocking functionality

## Related Components
- Modular design patterns
- Component extraction tools
- Architecture documentation
- Cross-reference management
