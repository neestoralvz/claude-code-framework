# Package 7: Directive & Authority Systems Migration

## Scope
Migrate directive and authority components that control system behavior:

### Files to Migrate
- `directive-authority-patterns.md` â†’ `principles/directive.md`
- `directive-implementation.md` â†’ `principles/directive.md`  
- `directive-integration.md` â†’ `principles/directive.md`
- `directive-load-order.md` â†’ `principles/directive.md`
- `directive-validation.md` â†’ `principles/directive.md`

## Migration Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Directive Components Content
- ðŸ“‹ Review each directive-*.md file for unique content
- ðŸ“‹ Identify overlaps and consolidation opportunities  
- ðŸ“‹ Map content to directive.md sections

### Step 2: Consolidate into principles/directive.md
- ðŸ“‹ Enhance existing directive.md with component content
- ðŸ“‹ Ensure no authority patterns are lost
- ðŸ“‹ Maintain load order specifications
- ðŸ“‹ Preserve implementation guidance

### Step 3: Update System References
- ðŸ“‹ Update CLAUDE.md references to directive components
- ðŸ“‹ Update any agents referencing directive patterns
- ðŸ“‹ Update principle load order in CLAUDE.md

## Content Preview Analysis

### directive-authority-patterns.md
- Authority declaration patterns
- Hierarchical authority structures
- Conflict resolution patterns
- **Status**: Critical content - must preserve

### directive-implementation.md
- Implementation patterns for directives
- Execution methodologies
- Compliance verification
- **Status**: Implementation guidance - consolidate

### directive-integration.md
- Integration with other principles
- Cross-system interactions
- Dependency patterns
- **Status**: Integration patterns - merge

### directive-load-order.md
- Principle loading sequence
- Dependency management
- Load order authority
- **Status**: Critical system behavior - preserve

### directive-validation.md
- Directive compliance validation
- Authority verification
- System integrity checks
- **Status**: Validation patterns - important

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Impact**: System authority and control
- **Mitigation**: Preserve all authority patterns exactly

## Success Criteria
- [x] All directive authority patterns preserved in directive.md
- [x] Load order specifications maintained
- [x] Implementation guidance consolidated
- [x] Integration patterns preserved
- [x] Validation mechanisms intact
- [x] CLAUDE.md authority chain unbroken

## Completion Summary
**Completed**: 2025-08-18
**Impact**: 5 directive component files successfully consolidated into enhanced principles/directive.md with all authority patterns, load order specifications, validation mechanisms, and integration patterns preserved. System authority chain remains intact with enhanced accessibility through centralized directive implementation hub.

## Special Considerations
- Directive.md is referenced in CLAUDE.md as authority
- Load order affects system initialization
- Authority patterns affect agent behavior
- Must maintain system control integrity

## Testing Requirements
- Verify CLAUDE.md initialization sequence works
- Check directive load order compliance
- Confirm authority patterns function correctly
- Validate system control mechanisms
