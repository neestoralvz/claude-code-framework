# CREATE TICKET EXECUTOR AGENT

## Problem Statement

⏺ **Principle**: This ticket implements [agent-selection.md mandatory requirements](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md#ticket-generation-requirements) by addressing missing agent capability that blocks task execution.

**Current Issue**: No suitable agent exists in /agents/ folder for ticket execution tasks, specifically:
- Ticket MOD-003 "Extract Table of Contents Template" execution requested
- Registry shows ticket as completed but file doesn't exist (discrepancy investigation needed)
- Current agents lack ticket lifecycle management and 8-phase workflow execution capabilities

**Blocking Impact**: Cannot execute ticket-based tasks per agent-selection.md mandatory agent-first requirements

## Required Agent Specification

### Agent Identity
- **Name**: ticket-executor
- **Description**: Specialized agent for comprehensive ticket lifecycle management and execution
- **Model**: sonnet
- **Color**: green
- **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, LS, TodoWrite, Bash

### Core Responsibilities
1. **Ticket Investigation**: Analyze ticket discrepancies and validate registry accuracy
2. **Workflow Execution**: Execute 8-phase workflow methodology for ticket completion
3. **Registry Management**: Synchronize ticket status with actual file existence
4. **Validation & Reporting**: Generate comprehensive completion reports with validation results
5. **Quality Assurance**: Apply engineering standards and framework compliance

### Specialized Capabilities
- **Discrepancy Resolution**: Investigate and resolve ticket-registry mismatches
- **Systematic Execution**: Apply workflow.md 8-phase methodology systematically
- **Documentation Updates**: Manage PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md and registry updates
- **Validation Framework**: Use validation templates for quality gates
- **Completion Tracking**: Move tickets between status categories accurately

### Operational Framework
- Follow workflow.md 8-phase systematic methodology
- Apply engineering.md technical standards throughout
- Update documentation per files.md principles
- Validate against success criteria per workflow.md#7-validation
- Generate detailed execution reports with phase completion status

## Original Blocked Request

**Task**: Execute ticket MOD-003 "Extract Table of Contents Template"
**Context**: User requested systematic 8-phase workflow execution
**Requirements**: 
- Phase-by-phase completion tracking
- Validation results and quality gate outcomes
- Registry updates and file management actions
- Success criteria verification
- Next recommended actions

## Success Criteria

✅ **Agent Creation**:
- [ ] ticket-executor.md agent file created in /agents/ folder
- [ ] Agent follows agent-architect.md gold standard structure
- [ ] Tools assigned without unnecessary permissions
- [ ] Core responsibilities clearly defined

✅ **Capability Validation**:
- [ ] Agent can investigate ticket discrepancies
- [ ] Agent can execute 8-phase workflow methodology
- [ ] Agent can update registries and documentation
- [ ] Agent can generate validation reports

✅ **Integration Testing**:
- [ ] Agent successfully executes MOD-003 ticket
- [ ] Agent resolves registry-file discrepancy
- [ ] Agent provides comprehensive completion report
- [ ] Agent follows all framework principles

## Implementation Notes

⏺ **Principle**: Agent creation follows [agent-definition.md](../../../docs/agents-docs/agent-definition.md) for expert scope precision and [engineering.md](../../../docs/principles/engineering.md) for modular design.

- Deploy agent-creator to build this specialized agent
- Ensure agent scope covers ticket lifecycle but not broader system management
- Validate agent effectiveness through MOD-003 execution test
- Document agent capabilities in agents documentation

## Priority Justification

**CRITICAL Priority** because:
- Blocks all ticket execution per agent-selection.md mandatory requirements
- Prevents systematic workflow execution
- Breaks agent-first delegation framework
- Impacts user task completion capability

## Next Actions

1. Deploy agent-creator to build ticket-executor agent
2. Test agent with MOD-003 ticket execution
3. Validate agent integration with existing framework
4. Update agent catalog and documentation
