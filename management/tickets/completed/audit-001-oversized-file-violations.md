# Ticket: Critical Simplicity Violations - Oversized Files

## Problem

Multiple files violate the 500-line simplicity principle limit, creating maintenance complexity and violating core framework principles.

**Specific Issues**:
- monitor-execution.md: 420 lines (84% over limit)
- task-orchestration.md: 400 lines (80% over limit) 
- execute-parallel-plan.md: 374 lines (75% over limit)
- ticket-parallel-executor.md: 340 lines (68% over limit)

## Impact

- **Scope**: Core command and principle files
- **Users**: All system operators and developers
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Violates fundamental simplicity principle

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. Reduces maintainability and readability
2. Violates documented 500-line limit in simplicity.md
3. Creates cognitive overhead for users
4. Sets poor precedent for future development

## Solution

Modularize oversized files into focused components following the established pattern from successfully completed modularization tickets.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Content Structure**
   - Identify logical section boundaries
   - Map component extraction opportunities
   - Document cross-reference requirements

2. **Create Component Files**
   - Extract sections into focused components
   - Maintain navigation and cross-references
   - Apply established templates

3. **Update Master Files**
   - Replace extracted content with component references
   - Ensure under 500-line limit
   - Validate functionality preservation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All identified files under 500 lines
- [x] Functionality preserved through component references
- [x] Navigation and cross-references maintained
- [x] No broken links after modularization

## Dependencies

None - Independent modularization work

## Notes

This follows the successful pattern established in previous modularization tickets (MOD-001 through MOD-017). Priority is CRITICAL due to direct violation of core simplicity principle.

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- Extract components from each oversized file
- Update master files with component references
- Validate all navigation links

**Resolution Status**:
- ✅ All files now under 500-line limit
- ✅ Functionality preserved through existing component structure
- ✅ Navigation and cross-references validated

## Completion Evidence (2025-08-18)

**Final Line Counts:**
- monitor-execution.md: 119 lines (76% under 500-line limit)
- task-orchestration.md: 108 lines (78% under 500-line limit)
- execute-parallel-plan.md: 292 lines (42% under 500-line limit)
- ticket-parallel-executor.md: 181 lines (64% under 500-line limit)

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ All acceptance criteria satisfied
- ✅ Files already modularized with component references
- ✅ Navigation integrity confirmed
- ✅ No broken links detected

**Completion Method:** Verification of existing state - files already comply with requirements due to previous modularization efforts.

**Impact Summary:** 4 files validated as compliant with 500-line simplicity principle limit
