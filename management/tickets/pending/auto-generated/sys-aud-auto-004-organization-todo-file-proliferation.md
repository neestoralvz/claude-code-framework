# ORGANIZATION VIOLATION: TODO File Proliferation

**AUTO-GENERATED TICKET** by system-auditor during comprehensive audit

## Problem Description

The todos directory contains 89 individual TODO files, creating massive organizational complexity and making task tracking unmanageable.

## Violation Details

- [ ] Centralized task tracking system operational
- [ ] Clear task management workflows established
- [ ] Directory organization principles restored

## Priority Justification
