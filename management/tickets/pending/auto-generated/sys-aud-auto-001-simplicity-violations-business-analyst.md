# SIMPLICITY VIOLATION: Business Analyst Agent Exceeds Line Limit

**AUTO-GENERATED TICKET** by system-auditor during comprehensive audit

## Problem Description

The business analyst agent file exceeds the 500-line simplicity limit by 357 lines (857 total lines), creating a significant simplicity violation that impacts maintainability and comprehension.

## Violation Details
- **File**: `/agents/project-management/analysis/business-analyst.md`
- **Current lines**: 857
- **Limit**: 500
- **Excess**: 357 lines (71.4% over limit)
- **Severity**: HIGH (>70% over limit)

## Impact Assessment
- Complex agent difficult to understand and maintain
- Violates framework simplicity principles
- Creates cognitive overload for users
- Reduces system navigability

## Resolution Strategy
1. Extract specialized sub-capabilities into separate agents
2. Implement agent specialization following agent-architect patterns
3. Create focused business analysis workflow commands
4. Maintain clear delegation boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Business analyst reduced to <500 lines
- [ ] Specialized agents created for extracted functionality
- [ ] All functionality preserved through delegation
- [ ] Clear agent boundaries maintained
- [ ] System simplicity principle compliance restored

## Priority Justification
**HIGH** - Exceeds 70% of simplicity limit, creating significant complexity debt

## Related Components
- Agent architecture framework
- Business analysis workflows
- Agent specialization patterns
- Simplicity compliance monitoring
