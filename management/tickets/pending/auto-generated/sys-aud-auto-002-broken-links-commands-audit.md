# STRUCTURAL VIOLATION: Broken Command Links in CLAUDE.md

**AUTO-GENERATED TICKET** by system-auditor during comprehensive audit

## Problem Description

Critical navigation links in CLAUDE.md point to non-existent command files, breaking the primary operational directive navigation system.

## Violation Details
- **File**: `/CLAUDE.md`
- **Broken Links**:
  - `commands/system-audit.md` (should be `commands/analysis/system-audit.md`)
  - `commands/create-ticket.md` (should be `commands/management/create-ticket.md`)
- **Impact**: PRIMARY NAVIGATION FAILURE

## Impact Assessment
- Breaks core operational navigation
- Violates ultimate authority document integrity
- Creates user confusion and workflow disruption
- Undermines framework reliability

## Resolution Strategy
1. Update all command links to correct paths
2. Validate all cross-references in CLAUDE.md
3. Implement automated link checking
4. Add link validation to quality gates

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All command links in CLAUDE.md point to valid files
- [ ] Cross-reference integrity validated
- [ ] Navigation system fully functional
- [ ] Automated link checking implemented

## Priority Justification
**HIGH** - Breaks primary operational navigation system

## Related Components
- Primary navigation system
- Command architecture
- Cross-reference validation
- Quality gate automation
