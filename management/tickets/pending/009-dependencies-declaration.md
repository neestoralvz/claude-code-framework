# Ticket: Consolidate Dependencies Declaration

## Problem
Dependencies declaration patterns overlap 60% across principle files.

## Impact
- **Lines affected**: ~45 lines
- **Files affected**: 9 principle files
- **Duplication rate**: 60%

## Current Pattern
Various dependency declarations in frontmatter:
```yaml
dependencies:
  - workflow.md
  - directive.md
  - fundamental.md
  [varying combinations]
```

## Solution
Create standardized dependency sets for different document types.

## Implementation Steps
1. Analyze dependency patterns
2. Create standard dependency sets:
   - Core dependencies (all files)
   - Principle dependencies
   - Command dependencies
   - Agent dependencies
3. Document dependency relationships
4. Update files to use standard sets
5. Remove redundant declarations

## Expected Benefits
- Reduce dependency overlap
- Clarify relationships
- Simplify maintenance
- Improve consistency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dependency sets defined
- [ ] Relationships documented
- [ ] Files updated
- [ ] Dependencies validated
- [ ] No redundant declarations

## Dependencies
Requires analysis of all file relationships

## Notes
Lower priority but improves clarity.
