# Ticket: Reduce parallel-intent-analysis.md Command File Size to Meet Simplicity Standards

‚è∫ **Principle**: This ticket implements [simplicity.md](../../../docs/principles/simplicity.md) by reducing file complexity below the 250-line threshold through systematic modularization and component extraction.

## Problem

The parallel-intent-analysis.md command file exceeds the simplicity principle threshold with 366 lines, violating the framework's core simplicity standards by 46% over the limit.

**Specific Issues**:
- Command file contains 366 lines (146% of 250-line limit)
- Complex orchestration protocols embedded within command documentation
- Extensive agent coordination schemas dilute core intent analysis functionality
- Multiple validation frameworks and quality gates create cognitive overhead

## Impact

- **Scope**: Affects orchestration command usability, maintainability, and framework compliance
- **Users**: All developers using parallel intent analysis for complex workflow orchestration
- **Severity**: HIGH - Violates core framework principles and complicates intent analysis adoption

**Specific Impact Details**:
1. File complexity obscures essential parallel intent analysis functionality
2. Violates simplicity.md principle requirement for focused, digestible commands
3. Creates maintenance burden for orchestration workflow updates

## Solution

Implement systematic modularization by extracting orchestration protocols and agent coordination schemas to specialized components while preserving core intent analysis workflow in simplified main command.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Preparation and Analysis**
   - Analyze current parallel-intent-analysis.md structure and identify extractable components
   - Map essential intent analysis workflow vs. orchestration documentation
   - Design component extraction strategy maintaining orchestration integrity

2. **Core Implementation**
   - Extract orchestration protocols to separate component files
   - Reduce main command to essential intent analysis execution
   - Create specialized components for agent coordination schemas
   - Implement cross-references to extracted components

3. **Validation and Integration**
   - Verify simplified command maintains full intent analysis capability
   - Test component references and ensure seamless orchestration
   - Validate compliance with 250-line simplicity threshold

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] parallel-intent-analysis.md file reduced to under 250 lines while maintaining functionality
- [ ] Orchestration protocols extracted to appropriate component files
- [ ] Agent coordination schemas moved to specialized components
- [ ] No regression in intent analysis or orchestration capability
- [ ] Full compliance with simplicity.md principle requirements

## Dependencies

- Reference to [simplicity.md](../../../docs/principles/simplicity.md) for threshold requirements
- Reference to [organization.md](../../../docs/principles/organization.md) for modular design patterns
- Component extraction following [modularization guidelines](../../../docs/principles/organization.md)

## Notes

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `commands/orchestration/parallel-intent-analysis.md` - Reduce to essential intent analysis workflow
- `docs/templates/components/orchestration-protocols.md` - Extract orchestration protocols
- `docs/templates/components/agent-coordination-schemas.md` - Extract coordination documentation
- `docs/templates/components/parallel-validation-framework.md` - Extract validation details

**Principle Violations**:
- Violates [simplicity.md](../../../docs/principles/simplicity.md) by exceeding 250-line complexity threshold
- Impacts [organization.md](../../../docs/principles/organization.md) by mixing command and orchestration documentation

**Framework Integration**:
- Connects to [workflow.md](../../../docs/principles/workflow.md) through systematic 8-phase extraction
- Supports [organization.md](../../../docs/principles/organization.md) by implementing modular design patterns
