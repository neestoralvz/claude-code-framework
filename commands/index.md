All enhanced commands must implement:
- **[Apply enhanced command template architecture](templates/enhanced-command-template.md)**: Complete execution environment structure
- **[Implement command architecture patterns](../docs/components/command-architecture-patterns.md)**: Integration and embedding patterns
- **[Follow command-centered execution](../CLAUDE.md)**: ULTIMATE AUTHORITY delegation protocol
- **[Apply embedded principle integration](../docs/PRINCIPLES.md)**: Direct application vs. external references

### Enhanced Quality Assurance

## Workflow Integration

### Phase Standardization
Commands reference [Execute workflow-phases.md consistent execution](../docs/components/workflow-phases.md#standard-phases) instead of duplicating phase definitions, ensuring:
- **Consistency**: Single source of workflow truth
- **Maintenance**: Updates propagate to all commands
- **Clarity**: Command-specific adaptations clearly documented
- **Efficiency**: Elimination of redundant phase descriptions

### Command-Specific Adaptations
Each command defines specific phase implementations while maintaining core workflow structure:
- **create-ticket**: [Apply ticket generation variant](../docs/components/workflow-phases.md#create-ticket)
- **modularize**: [Apply component extraction variant](../docs/components/workflow-phases.md#modularize)
- **review-tickets**: [Apply priority execution variant](../docs/components/workflow-phases.md#review-tickets)
- **system-audit**: [Apply system analysis variant](../docs/components/workflow-phases.md#system-audit)
