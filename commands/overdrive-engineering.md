## Integrated Execution Environment

⏺ **Architecture**: This command serves as a COMPLETE EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT for anti-over-engineering enforcement, handling the entire complexity management workflow from detection through resolution.

### Command Purpose
Automatically detect, prevent, and resolve over-engineering patterns while maintaining system simplicity through intelligent workflow orchestration and continuous monitoring.

### Execution Authority
This command operates with FULL EXECUTION AUTHORITY per command-centered architecture:
- **Complete Complexity Management**: Manages entire complexity lifecycle internally
- **Integrated Simplicity Enforcement**: Built-in SIMPLE framework validation at every phase
- **Automatic Detection and Resolution**: Handles complexity detection, analysis, and refactoring workflows
- **Self-Contained Optimization**: Delivers complete, validated simplicity improvements

### Core Anti-Over-Engineering Mission
```yaml
mission_framework:
  primary_directive: "Maintain system simplicity through proactive complexity management"
  detection_scope: ["code_complexity", "architectural_complexity", "interface_complexity", "process_complexity"]
  enforcement_methods: ["automated_detection", "intelligent_refactoring", "continuous_monitoring", "preventive_validation"]
  success_metrics: ["complexity_budget_compliance", "simplicity_debt_reduction", "maintainability_improvement"]
```

## Embedded SIMPLE Framework

⏺ **SIMPLE Integration**: This command DIRECTLY APPLIES the SIMPLE decision framework for complexity evaluation and prevention, ensuring consistent anti-over-engineering enforcement.

### SIMPLE Framework Implementation
```yaml
simple_framework:
  specific:
    validation: "Does this solve a specific, current problem?"
    enforcement: automatic_requirement_verification
    gate_criteria: concrete_problem_definition
    
  immediate:
    validation: "Is this needed now, not hypothetically later?"
    enforcement: future_proofing_prevention
    gate_criteria: current_necessity_proof
    
  measurable:
    validation: "Can we measure the benefit objectively?"
    enforcement: quantitative_benefit_analysis
    gate_criteria: measurable_improvement_metrics
    
  practical:
    validation: "Does this make daily work easier?"
    enforcement: usability_impact_assessment
    gate_criteria: workflow_improvement_verification
    
  lean:
    validation: "Is this the minimum viable solution?"
    enforcement: complexity_minimization_check
    gate_criteria: minimal_sufficient_implementation
    
  evidenced:
    validation: "Do we have proof this approach works?"
    enforcement: evidence_based_validation
    gate_criteria: proven_approach_verification
```

### Framework Application Logic
1. **Pre-Implementation Screening**: Every complexity addition must pass SIMPLE validation
2. **Real-time Complexity Monitoring**: Continuous SIMPLE compliance checking during development
3. **Refactoring Decision Support**: SIMPLE framework guides simplification priorities
4. **Abstraction Threshold Enforcement**: SIMPLE criteria determine when abstractions are justified

## Automatic Complexity Detection
