# SYSTEM EVOLVE COMMAND

## Purpose

‚è∫ **Principle**: This command implements [workflow.md systematic execution](../../docs/principles/workflow.md#evolutionary-analysis) by analyzing system-wide inconsistencies and applies [engineering.md quality standards](../../docs/principles/engineering.md#coherence-validation) through comprehensive evolutionary alignment assessment.

Analyze system inconsistencies, align components with current changes, and ensure coherence across the entire system through evolutionary improvement identification and systematic alignment validation.

## Command Syntax

```bash
# Basic evolutionary analysis
system-evolve

# Comprehensive evolution with specific focus
system-evolve --scope comprehensive --focus alignment

# Targeted evolution analysis
system-evolve --scope minimal --output detailed --priority HIGH
```

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: System State Assessment
- Scan entire codebase for inconsistency patterns
- Identify components not aligned with current architectural decisions
- Map dependencies and cross-references for coherence analysis
- Document baseline system state and evolution requirements

### Phase 2: Evolutionary Gap Analysis
- Compare current implementations against established patterns
- Identify outdated patterns and legacy inconsistencies
- Detect misaligned components requiring evolutionary updates
- Generate evolutionary pressure points and improvement opportunities

### Phase 3: Coherence Impact Analysis
- Analyze ripple effects of evolutionary changes
- Map component interdependencies and alignment requirements
- Identify cascade alignment opportunities across system boundaries
- Validate evolutionary change feasibility and impact scope

### Phase 4: Evolutionary Alignment Planning
- Design systematic evolution pathways for identified inconsistencies
- Prioritize alignment changes based on impact and effort analysis
- **Generate evolutionary tickets with critical findings automatically**
- **Add tickets to TICKET_REGISTRY.md with proper categorization**
- Create coherence validation framework for systematic verification

### Phase 5: Ticket Generation & Validation Framework
- **Generate tickets for each critical finding with specific details**
- **Assign priority levels based on severity and impact analysis**
- **Update TICKET_REGISTRY.md with new evolutionary tickets**
- Establish metrics for measuring system coherence improvement
- Define success criteria for evolutionary alignment validation
- Create monitoring framework for ongoing coherence assessment
- Document evolutionary progress tracking and measurement standards

## Parameters

### Required Parameters

## Integration Points

### Workflow Integration
- Integrates with [system-audit.md](system-audit.md) for baseline analysis
- **Automatically generates tickets via [create-ticket.md](../management/create-ticket.md) for critical findings**
- **Updates [TICKET_REGISTRY.md](../../docs/planning/TICKET_REGISTRY.md) with evolutionary tickets**
- Connects with [execute-parallel-plan.md](../execution/execute-parallel-plan.md) for coordinated evolution

### Agent Coordination
- Coordinates with [project-optimizer](../../agents/project-optimizer.md) for strategic evolution
- Utilizes [validation-engineer](../../agents/validation-engineer.md) for coherence verification
- Leverages [migration-specialist](../../agents/migration-specialist.md) for systematic evolution

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete system inconsistency identification and documentation
- [ ] Evolutionary gap analysis with prioritized improvement pathways
- [ ] Coherence violation detection with specific alignment requirements
- [ ] **Generated evolutionary tickets automatically added to TICKET_REGISTRY.md**
- [ ] **Tickets include critical findings with specific file locations and remediation steps**
- [ ] Generated evolutionary tickets with clear success criteria and effort estimates
- [ ] Coherence validation framework with measurable improvement metrics
- [ ] System-wide alignment recommendations with implementation guidance

## Usage Examples

### Comprehensive System Evolution with Ticket Generation
```bash
system-evolve --scope comprehensive --focus all --generate-tickets true
# Expected result: Complete evolutionary analysis with automatic ticket generation for critical findings
```

### Targeted High-Priority Analysis with Tickets
```bash
system-evolve --scope minimal --focus alignment --priority HIGH --ticket-prefix "CRITICAL"
# Expected result: High-priority alignment issues with automatically generated CRITICAL-prefixed tickets
```

### Coherence Analysis with Registry Integration
