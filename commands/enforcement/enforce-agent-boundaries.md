# ENFORCE AGENT BOUNDARIES COMMAND

## Purpose

⏺ **Principle**: This command implements [CLAUDE.md AGENT BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT](../../CLAUDE.md#agent-boundary-enforcement) by detecting and eliminating delegation redundancy patterns that violate the single delegation layer principle.

**ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRITY ENFORCER**: This command systematically scans for and removes agent delegation intermediaries that create redundant architecture layers between the main assistant and specialist agents.

## Agent Boundary Violation Detection

⏺ **Principle**: Implements [CLAUDE.md FORBIDDEN PATTERN](../../CLAUDE.md#agent-boundary-enforcement) detection through systematic analysis of agent delegation patterns.

### Violation Categories

```yaml
forbidden_patterns:
  delegation_intermediaries:
    pattern: "Agent that delegates to other agents"
    examples: ["ticket-executor", "task-coordinator", "workflow-orchestrator"]
    violation: "Creates redundant delegation layer"
    
  agent_identity_assumption:
    pattern: "Main assistant assuming agent role"
    examples: ["I am a specialist", "As an expert agent"]
    violation: "Main assistant must remain orchestrator only"
    
  multi_layer_delegation:
    pattern: "Command → Delegator Agent → Specialist Agent"
    examples: ["execute-ticket → ticket-executor → specialist"]
    violation: "Should be Command → Specialist Agent directly"
```

### Command Syntax
```bash
enforce-agent-boundaries                          # Full system scan
enforce-agent-boundaries --agents-only           # Scan agents directory only
enforce-agent-boundaries --commands-only         # Scan commands directory only
enforce-agent-boundaries --fix                   # Auto-fix violations where possible
```

## Boundary Enforcement Workflow

⏺ **Principle**: Implements [CLAUDE.md SINGLE DELEGATION LAYER](../../CLAUDE.md#agent-boundary-enforcement) through systematic violation detection and remediation.

### Phase 1: System Scanning
- Scan all agents in `/agents/` directory for delegation patterns
- Analyze commands in `/commands/` directory for proper delegation architecture
- Identify references to intermediary delegation agents
- Document boundary violations with specific file locations

### Phase 2: Violation Analysis
- **Delegation Intermediary Detection**: Identify agents that delegate to other agents
- **Identity Assumption Analysis**: Check for main assistant role confusion
- **Architecture Layer Counting**: Validate single delegation layer compliance
- **Pattern Recognition**: Classify violation types and severity

### Phase 3: Impact Assessment
- Determine dependencies on violating agents
- Assess command modifications required for direct delegation
- Evaluate integration complexity for boundary corrections
- Prioritize violations by architectural impact

### Phase 4: Remediation Planning
- **Agent Elimination**: Plan removal of delegation intermediary agents
- **Command Enhancement**: Design direct specialist delegation logic
- **Reference Updates**: Identify all cross-references requiring updates
- **Migration Strategy**: Develop step-by-step remediation approach

### Phase 5: Violation Remediation
- Remove delegation intermediary agents from system
- Update commands to delegate directly to specialists
- Fix all cross-references to eliminated agents
- Validate architectural compliance after changes

### Phase 6: Compliance Validation
- Re-scan system for remaining boundary violations
- Verify single delegation layer architecture maintained
- Confirm no orphaned references to removed agents
- Validate command execution flow integrity

### Phase 7: Documentation Updates
- Update PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md with boundary enforcement rules
- Document architectural changes and rationale
- Create prevention guidelines for future development
- Generate compliance report with validation evidence

### Phase 8: Prevention Integration
- Integrate boundary checks into development workflows
- Create validation rules for new agent development
- Establish architectural review checkpoints
- Monitor for future boundary violation introduction

## Violation Detection Patterns

### Agent Delegation Signatures
```yaml
delegation_indicators:
  task_tool_usage: "agents/*.md containing Task tool references"
  delegation_language: "delegate|orchestrate|coordinate.*agent|deploy.*agent"
  selection_logic: "agent selection|choose agent|route to agent"
  intermediary_roles: "orchestrator|coordinator|delegator|router"
```

### Command Architecture Violations
```yaml
command_violations:
  indirect_delegation: "Command → Agent → Agent pattern"
  missing_direct_deployment: "Commands not using Task tool directly"
  agent_selection_delegation: "Commands delegating agent selection"
  intermediary_references: "References to delegation intermediary agents"
```

## Remediation Strategies

### Agent Elimination Protocol
```yaml
elimination_process:
  step_1: "Identify all dependencies on delegation agent"
  step_2: "Move agent capabilities to appropriate commands"
  step_3: "Update commands to delegate directly to specialists"
  step_4: "Remove agent file and all references"
  step_5: "Validate no broken cross-references remain"
```

### Command Enhancement Protocol
```yaml
enhancement_process:
  step_1: "Add specialist selection logic to command"
  step_2: "Implement direct Task tool deployment"
  step_3: "Include agent selection matrix integration"
  step_4: "Remove references to delegation intermediary"
  step_5: "Test direct delegation functionality"
```

## Error Handling

### Violation Not Found
```bash
✅ COMPLIANT: No agent boundary violations detected
📊 ARCHITECTURE: Single delegation layer maintained
🛡️  INTEGRITY: Agent boundaries properly enforced
```

### Critical Violations Detected
```bash
❌ VIOLATIONS: [count] agent boundary violations found
🚨 CRITICAL: Delegation intermediary agents detected
📋 VIOLATIONS: [list of specific violations with locations]
🔧 REMEDIATION: Run with --fix flag to auto-remediate
```

### Auto-Fix Successful
```bash
🔧 FIXED: [count] boundary violations automatically remediated
✅ COMPLIANCE: Single delegation layer architecture restored
📊 CHANGES: [list of files modified/removed]
🛡️  VALIDATION: Agent boundaries now properly enforced
```
