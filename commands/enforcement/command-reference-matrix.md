# Command Reference Matrix - Automatic Problem Detection and Remediation

⏺ **Principle**: Implement [directive.md ultimate authority](../../docs/principles/directive.md) through intelligent command mapping and apply [workflow.md systematic execution](../../docs/principles/workflow.md) for automated problem resolution.

## Command Purpose

Provide comprehensive command reference matrix that maps problem types to specific enforcement commands with escalation pathways, enabling automatic problem detection and guided command selection for system self-monitoring.

## Command Execution

### Phase 1: Problem Classification Matrix

**Execute automatic problem categorization:**

#### Critical Violations (Emergency Response Required)
| Problem Type | Detection Criteria | Primary Command | Escalation Command | Emergency Protocol |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Direct Task Execution** | Bypassing command delegation | `enforce-delegation-workflow.md` | `enforce-system-initialization.md` | Conversation termination |
| **Agent Role Assumption** | Taking on agent persona | `protocol-compliance-verifier.md` | `enforce-delegation-workflow.md` | System re-initialization |
| **CLAUDE.md Authority Bypass** | Contradicting ultimate authority | `enforce-system-initialization.md` | `protocol-compliance-verifier.md` | Emergency lockdown |
| **Framework Circumvention** | Attempting command bypass | `enforce-delegation-workflow.md` | `system-initialization.md` | Complete system reset |

#### High Priority Violations (System Re-initialization Required)
| Problem Type | Detection Criteria | Primary Command | Secondary Command | Monitoring Command |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Incomplete System Initialization** | Missing principle loading | `system-initialization.md` | `enforce-system-initialization.md` | `protocol-compliance-verifier.md` |
| **Command Selection Errors** | Wrong command for task type | `command-reference-matrix.md` | `create-ticket.md` | `system-audit.md` |
| **Delegation Boundary Violations** | Improper specialist deployment | `enforce-delegation-workflow.md` | `protocol-compliance-verifier.md` | `system-audit.md` |
| **Quality Gate Failures** | Validation not completed | `validation-framework.md` | `enforce-system-initialization.md` | `system-audit.md` |

#### Medium Priority Violations (Enhanced Monitoring Required)
| Problem Type | Detection Criteria | Primary Command | Support Command | Analysis Command |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Command Usage Inconsistencies** | Non-optimal command selection | `command-reference-matrix.md` | `create-ticket.md` | `system-audit.md` |
| **Cross-Reference Errors** | Broken documentation links | `system-audit.md` | `create-ticket.md` | `analyze-dependencies.md` |
| **Ticket Generation Issues** | Improper task documentation | `create-ticket.md` | `review-tickets.md` | `system-audit.md` |
| **Documentation Inconsistencies** | Framework documentation gaps | `system-audit.md` | `create-ticket.md` | `multi-analysis-execution.md` |

### Phase 2: Command Selection Intelligence

**Execute context-aware command mapping:**

#### System State Analysis Matrix
```
Current System State → Problem Severity → Recommended Command Sequence

Uninitialized System:
├─ Any Violation → Critical → system-initialization.md → protocol-compliance-verifier.md
└─ Request Received → High → system-initialization.md → command-reference-matrix.md

Partially Initialized System:
├─ Critical Violations → Emergency → enforce-system-initialization.md → conversation termination
├─ High Priority → Re-init → system-initialization.md → enforce-delegation-workflow.md
└─ Medium Priority → Monitor → protocol-compliance-verifier.md → enhanced monitoring

Fully Operational System:
├─ Critical Violations → Emergency → enforce-delegation-workflow.md → emergency protocols
├─ High Priority → Correct → protocol-compliance-verifier.md → system re-validation
└─ Medium Priority → Guide → command-reference-matrix.md → optimization recommendations
```

#### Context-Aware Command Selection Algorithm
1. **Analyze Current System State**
   - Check system initialization completion status
   - Verify command framework operational readiness
   - Assess recent violation history and patterns
   - Evaluate user request complexity and type

2. **Map Problem to Command Category**
   - **System Foundation Issues** → management/system-initialization.md
   - **Protocol Compliance Issues** → enforcement/enforce-system-initialization.md
   - **Delegation Violations** → enforcement/enforce-delegation-workflow.md
   - **Quality Failures** → validation/comprehensive-validation-framework.md

3. **Select Optimal Command Sequence**
   - Primary command for immediate problem resolution
   - Secondary command for comprehensive remediation
   - Monitoring command for ongoing verification
   - Escalation command for failure scenarios

### Phase 3: Automatic Trigger Mechanisms

**Execute proactive command execution:**

#### Session State Monitoring Triggers
```
Session Start → Automatic → system-initialization.md
├─ Success → Continue to user interaction readiness
├─ Partial → Retry → enforce-system-initialization.md
└─ Failure → Emergency → protocol-compliance-verifier.md → conversation termination

User Request Received → Automatic → protocol-compliance-verifier.md
├─ Compliant → Continue to command selection
├─ Minor Violation → Guide → command-reference-matrix.md
└─ Major Violation → Block → enforce-delegation-workflow.md
```

#### Real-Time Compliance Monitoring
```
Continuous Monitoring → protocol-compliance-verifier.md
├─ Critical Violation Detected → Immediate → conversation termination
├─ High Priority Violation → Urgent → system re-initialization sequence
├─ Medium Priority Violation → Schedule → enhanced monitoring activation
└─ Compliance Maintained → Continue → normal operation
```

#### Performance Threshold Triggers
```
Response Time Monitoring:
├─ Violation Detection >1 second → Optimize → performance-optimizer.md
├─ Command Selection >2 seconds → Analyze → system-audit.md
└─ System Recovery >30 seconds → Escalate → emergency protocols

Resource Utilization Monitoring:
├─ Memory Usage >500MB → Optimize → system-audit.md
├─ CPU Usage >15% → Analyze → performance-optimizer.md
└─ Network Overhead >1MB/hour → Monitor → enhanced system monitoring
```

### Phase 4: Intelligent Guidance System

**Execute contextual command recommendations:**

#### Manual Command Selection Guidance
```
Current System Context Analysis:
1. Recent violation history assessment
2. System performance metrics evaluation
3. User request pattern analysis
4. Framework compliance status review

Contextual Recommendations:
├─ New Session → system-initialization.md (automatic)
├─ System Issues → system-audit.md (comprehensive analysis)
├─ Task Management → create-ticket.md (systematic organization)
├─ Code Issues → modularize.md (structural organization)
├─ Workflow Needs → workflow/[1-8]-*.md (systematic phases)
├─ Complex Analysis → multi-analysis-execution.md (comprehensive synthesis)
└─ Violations Detected → enforcement/[specific-enforcement].md
```

#### Predictive Command Selection
```
Pattern Recognition Algorithm:
1. Analyze user request for task type indicators
2. Assess system state for optimal command readiness
3. Evaluate recent command execution success patterns
4. Predict optimal command sequence for task completion

Confidence Scoring:
├─ High Confidence (>90%) → Automatic command execution
├─ Medium Confidence (70-90%) → Recommended with confirmation
├─ Low Confidence (50-70%) → Multiple options with guidance
└─ Very Low Confidence (<50%) → create-ticket.md for specialist analysis
```
