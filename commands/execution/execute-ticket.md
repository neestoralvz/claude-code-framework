# EXECUTE TICKET COMMAND

## Purpose

‚è∫ **Principle**: This command implements [Follow CLAUDE.md ULTIMATE AUTHORITY](../../CLAUDE.md#critical-rules) through [Apply agent-selection.md MANDATORY agent-first execution](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md#mandatory-agent-usage) and [Apply workflow.md 8-phase systematic methodology](../../docs/principles/workflow.md#execution-phases).

**DIRECT SPECIALIST DEPLOYER**: This command analyzes ticket requirements and deploys specialist agents directly via Task tool. Implements clean single delegation layer architecture per CLAUDE.md agent boundary enforcement.

## Intelligent Agent Selection Protocol

‚è∫ **Principle**: Implements [Apply agent-selection.md systematic methodology](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md#selection-methodology) through multi-perspective analysis and optimal agent matching.

### Agent Selection Process
```bash
# SYSTEMATIC AGENT ANALYSIS:
# 1. Analyze ticket requirements from technical, functional, and strategic perspectives
# 2. Evaluate existing agent catalog (/agents/) for capability matches
# 3. Select optimal agent or deploy agent-creator for new agent development
# 4. Update ticket status to 'in_progress' and delegate execution
```

### Command Syntax
```bash
# INTELLIGENT AGENT SELECTION:
execute-ticket [TICKET-ID]                    # Analyze and select optimal agent
execute-ticket [TICKET-ID] --create-agent     # Force new agent creation if needed
execute-ticket [TICKET-ID] --analyze-only     # Show agent selection analysis only
```

## Agent Selection & Delegation Workflow

‚è∫ **Principle**: Implements [Apply workflow.md execution phases](../../docs/principles/workflow.md#execution-phases) and [Apply agent-selection.md intelligent analysis](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md#selection-methodology) through intelligent agent analysis and optimal task delegation.

### Phase 1: Ticket Analysis & Status Update
- Validate ticket ID exists in registry
- **Update ticket status to 'in_progress' in registry immediately**
- **Move ticket from PENDING to IN PROGRESS section in registry**
- Load ticket details and analyze requirements comprehensively
- Extract technical, functional, and strategic requirements

### Phase 2: Multi-Perspective Agent Analysis
- **Technical Perspective**: Assess implementation complexity, domain expertise, integration needs
- **Functional Perspective**: Determine task category, output requirements, success criteria
- **Strategic Perspective**: Evaluate user goals alignment, context preservation, long-term value
- Document agent selection rationale

### Phase 3: Agent Catalog Assessment
- Scan /agents/ folder for existing agent capabilities
- Evaluate scope alignment, capability coverage, and quality track record
- Apply selection rules: exact match priority, capability superset, avoid scope overlap
- Determine if suitable agent exists or new agent creation required

### Phase 4: Agent Selection Decision
- **If optimal agent exists**: Prepare agent deployment with ticket context
- **If no suitable agent**: Deploy agent-creator to develop specialized agent
- **If agent creation needed**: Generate agent specification and requirements
- Document selection decision and reasoning

### Phase 5: Agent Deployment
- Deploy selected agent via Task Tool with comprehensive ticket context
- Provide agent with ticket details, requirements, and success criteria
- Include validation expectations and quality standards
- Establish progress monitoring and communication protocols

### Phase 6: Execution Monitoring
- Monitor agent progress and provide support as needed
- Ensure agent follows 8-phase workflow for ticket execution
- Validate agent adherence to engineering standards and principles
- Maintain oversight of quality gates and validation checkpoints

### Phase 7: Completion Validation
- Verify agent completed all acceptance criteria
- Validate ticket status updated to 'completed' with proper documentation
- **Move ticket from IN PROGRESS to COMPLETED section in registry**
- Confirm PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md updated if structural changes made
- Ensure registry synchronization and metrics updates

### Phase 8: Results Integration
- Integrate agent results into main workflow context
- Document lessons learned from agent selection and execution
- Update agent catalog with performance feedback
- Provide recommendations for future similar tickets

## Validation Levels

### Agent Selection Validation
- Multi-perspective requirement analysis completed
- Agent catalog thoroughly assessed
- Optimal agent selection justified
- Deployment context properly prepared

### Agent Performance Validation
- Selected agent capabilities match ticket requirements
- Quality standards maintained throughout execution
- All workflow phases properly executed by agent
- Results meet acceptance criteria and engineering standards

### Delegation Quality Validation
- No direct execution performed by main instance
- Agent-first principles consistently applied
- Proper context handoff and result integration
- Framework compliance maintained throughout

## Error Handling

### Ticket Not Found
```bash
‚ùå ERROR: Ticket [TICKET-ID] not found in registry
üí° Available tickets: [list of pending tickets]
```

### No Suitable Agent Found
```bash
üîç ANALYSIS: No existing agent matches ticket requirements
üõ†Ô∏è  DEPLOYING: agent-creator to develop specialized agent
üìù CREATING: Agent specification for [specific capability]
‚è≥ STATUS: Ticket remains in_progress pending agent creation
```

### Agent Creation Required
```bash
üéØ AGENT NEEDED: [specific agent type] for [ticket category]
üìã REQUIREMENTS: [technical/functional/strategic needs]
üöÄ DEPLOYING: agent-creator with detailed specifications
‚è≥ TIMELINE: Agent creation and ticket execution in progress
```

## Agent Selection & Delegation Validation

‚è∫ **Principle**: This validation implements [Apply agent-selection.md systematic methodology](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md#selection-methodology) and [Apply workflow.md validation standards](../../docs/principles/workflow.md#8-validation).

Ensures optimal agent selection and delegation quality through comprehensive verification:

## Registry Integration

### Automatic Updates
- Status transitions: pending ‚Üí in_progress (immediately at execution start) ‚Üí completed (by selected agent)
- **Section movement**: PENDING TICKETS ‚Üí IN PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED ACHIEVEMENTS
- Execution start timestamp recording upon status change to 'in_progress'
- Agent selection decision and rationale logging
- Agent deployment and performance tracking
- Completion timestamp recording by deployed agent
- Effort tracking and metrics updates
- Statistics dashboard synchronization

### File Management
- Move ticket from /pending/ to /completed/ directory
- Update ticket file with completion metadata
- Maintain audit trail of execution

### Registry Section Movement Implementation

**Status Change: PENDING ‚Üí IN_PROGRESS**
1. Locate ticket in "üìä PENDING TICKETS BY PRIORITY" section
2. Move ticket entry to "üö® ACTIVE WORK QUEUE" ‚Üí "üîÑ IN PROGRESS" subsection
3. Update status from "‚è≥ PENDING" to "üîÑ IN PROGRESS"
4. Record execution start timestamp
5. Update metrics: decrease pending count, increase in_progress count

**Status Change: IN_PROGRESS ‚Üí COMPLETED**
1. Locate ticket in "üîÑ IN PROGRESS" subsection
2. Move ticket entry to "‚úÖ COMPLETED ACHIEVEMENTS" section under appropriate priority level
3. Update status from "üîÑ IN PROGRESS" to "‚úÖ COMPLETED"
4. Record completion timestamp and completion date
5. Update metrics: decrease in_progress count, increase completed count
6. Recalculate completion percentages and progress bars

```bash
# ANALYSIS: AUDIT-001 requires compliance checking and violation remediation
# TECHNICAL: File analysis, principle validation, structure assessment
# FUNCTIONAL: Report generation, recommendation development
# STRATEGIC: Framework integrity, quality assurance
# SELECTED AGENT: project-optimizer (system analysis specialization)
```

### Missing Capability Scenario
```bash
# ANALYSIS: CUSTOM-001 requires specialized database optimization
# TECHNICAL: Database-specific expertise not in catalog
# ASSESSMENT: No existing agent matches requirements
# DECISION: Deploy agent-creator to develop database-optimizer
# OUTCOME: New agent created, then deployed for ticket execution
```

### Agent Creation Success
```bash
# ANALYSIS: TICKET-001 requires specialized ticket lifecycle management
# ASSESSMENT: No suitable agent exists for ticket-specific operations
# DEPLOYMENT: agent-creator successfully creates ticket-executor
# RESULT: New ticket-executor agent handles all ticket operations
```
