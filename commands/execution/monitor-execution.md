# MONITOR EXECUTION COMMAND

## Purpose

⏺ **Principle**: This command implements [Apply workflow.md systematic execution monitoring](../../docs/principles/workflow.md#execution-phases) through systematic execution monitoring and applies [Apply organization.md structured progress tracking](../../docs/principles/organization.md#hierarchical-organization) for structured progress tracking.

Monitor parallel ticket execution with real-time dashboards, agent coordination tracking, and intervention capabilities for optimal execution management.

## Command Syntax

```bash
# Start real-time monitoring dashboard
monitor-execution --dashboard --refresh 5s

# Monitor specific execution session
monitor-execution --session [session-id] --detailed

# Monitor with specific focus areas
monitor-execution --focus [agents|resources|conflicts|progress]

# Generate monitoring report
monitor-execution --report --format [table|json|markdown] --output report.md

# Monitor with intervention capabilities
monitor-execution --interactive --control-enabled

# Background monitoring with alerts
monitor-execution --background --alerts --threshold critical
```

## Monitoring Capabilities

**[Apply execution-dashboard-displays.md for real-time monitoring](../docs/components/execution-dashboard-displays.md)**

**[Use agent-status-monitoring.md for agent coordination tracking](../docs/components/agent-status-monitoring.md)**

## Control and Intervention

**[Apply execution-control-commands.md for runtime control and intervention](../docs/components/execution-control-commands.md)**

## Monitoring Reports

**[Use execution-monitoring-reports.md for comprehensive reporting and analytics](../docs/components/execution-monitoring-reports.md)**

## Integration Points

### Registry Integration
- Real-time progress synchronization
- Automatic status updates
- Completion tracking and validation

### Agent System Integration
- Agent health monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Load balancing coordination

### Alert System Integration
- Threshold-based notifications
- Performance degradation alerts
- Resource exhaustion warnings

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```bash
# Start monitoring current execution
monitor-execution --dashboard --refresh 10s
```

### Detailed Analysis
```bash
# Comprehensive monitoring with reports
monitor-execution --detailed --agents --resources --generate-report
```

### Interactive Control
```bash
# Monitor with intervention capabilities
monitor-execution --interactive --control-enabled --alerts
```

### Background Monitoring
```bash
# Background monitoring with automated alerts
monitor-execution --background --alerts --threshold warning --log monitoring.log
```

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
- [ ] **Real-time Monitoring Accuracy**: Dashboard displays accurate, up-to-date execution status
- [ ] **Agent Coordination Tracking**: All agent activities and communications properly monitored
- [ ] **Performance Metrics Collection**: Comprehensive metrics captured for analysis and optimization
- [ ] **Intervention Capability Reliability**: Control commands execute promptly and effectively

### Quality Gates
- [ ] **Requirements Gate**: All monitoring requirements defined and tracking mechanisms configured
- [ ] **Process Gate**: Monitoring workflow executed systematically per methodology
- [ ] **Output Gate**: Reports and dashboards meet accuracy and completeness standards
- [ ] **System Gate**: Monitoring overhead minimal, no performance impact on execution

### Validation Evidence
- **Functional Testing**: Compare monitoring data with actual execution state verification
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure monitoring accuracy, response times, and data integrity
- **Documentation**: Generated reports contain accurate and complete execution information
- **Integration**: Dashboard synchronization with registry and agent systems verified

### Completion Verification
- [ ] **Monitoring Coverage**: 100% of execution activities tracked and reported accurately
- [ ] **Dashboard Functionality**: All monitoring interfaces operational and responsive
- [ ] **Alert System Effectiveness**: Critical events detected and notifications delivered promptly
- [ ] **Report Generation**: Comprehensive execution reports generated with actionable insights
