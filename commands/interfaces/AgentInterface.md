# AGENT INTERFACE - COORDINATION CONTRACT

## Purpose

⏺ **Interface Segregation**: This interface defines only agent coordination operations, adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle by separating agent management from command execution.

## Core Agent Contract

```yaml
AgentInterface:
  essential_methods:
    deploy_agent(requirements: AgentRequirements): AgentDeployment
    get_available_agents(): AgentCapability[]
    coordinate_agents(deployment: AgentDeployment[]): CoordinationResult
  
  coordination_types:
    single_agent: "Deploy single specialized agent"
    multi_agent: "Coordinate multiple agents"
    agent_chain: "Sequential agent execution"
    parallel_agents: "Concurrent agent operations"
```

## Agent Method Definitions

### 1. Agent Deployment
```yaml
deploy_agent_method:
  signature: "deploy_agent(requirements: AgentRequirements): AgentDeployment"
  responsibility: "Deploy agent matching requirements"
  parameters:
    requirements:
      type: "AgentRequirements"
      contains: ["capabilities", "complexity", "domain", "resources"]
  returns:
    type: "AgentDeployment"
    contains: ["agent_instance", "deployment_status", "capabilities", "metadata"]
```

### 2. Capability Discovery
```yaml
get_agents_method:
  signature: "get_available_agents(): AgentCapability[]"
  responsibility: "Discover available agent capabilities"
  returns:
    type: "AgentCapability[]"
    description: "Array of available agent capabilities and metadata"
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination
```yaml
coordinate_method:
  signature: "coordinate_agents(deployment: AgentDeployment[]): CoordinationResult"
  responsibility: "Coordinate multiple agent operations"
  parameters:
    deployment:
      type: "AgentDeployment[]"
      description: "Array of deployed agents to coordinate"
  returns:
    type: "CoordinationResult"
    contains: ["execution_plan", "dependencies", "monitoring_info"]
```

## Supporting Data Structures

### AgentRequirements
```yaml
AgentRequirements:
  capabilities: string[]
  complexity_level: "simple" | "moderate" | "complex"
  domain_expertise: string[]
  resource_requirements: ResourceRequirements
  execution_context: ExecutionContext
```

### AgentDeployment
```yaml
AgentDeployment:
  agent_id: string
  agent_instance: AgentInstance
  deployment_status: "ready" | "deploying" | "failed"
  capabilities: AgentCapability
  metadata: Map<string, any>
```

### AgentCapability
```yaml
AgentCapability:
  agent_id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  capabilities: string[]
  complexity_support: string[]
  domain_expertise: string[]
  availability_status: "available" | "busy" | "offline"
```

### CoordinationResult
```yaml
CoordinationResult:
  execution_plan: ExecutionPlan
  agent_dependencies: AgentDependency[]
  coordination_strategy: CoordinationStrategy
  monitoring_endpoints: MonitoringEndpoint[]
```

## Agent Deployment Strategies

### 1. Capability-Based Selection
```yaml
capability_based:
  approach: "Match requirements to agent capabilities"
  algorithm:
    - Analyze task requirements
    - Query available agent capabilities
    - Score capability matches
    - Select highest scoring agent
```

### 2. Load-Based Selection
```yaml
load_based:
  approach: "Consider agent current workload"
  algorithm:
    - Check agent availability status
    - Assess current workload
    - Balance load across agents
    - Deploy to least loaded suitable agent
```

### 3. Expertise-Based Selection
```yaml
expertise_based:
  approach: "Match domain expertise requirements"
  algorithm:
    - Identify domain requirements
    - Filter agents by expertise
    - Rank by expertise depth
    - Deploy most expert available agent
```

## Coordination Patterns

### 1. Sequential Coordination
```yaml
sequential:
  pattern: "Agents execute in order"
  use_cases: ["Pipeline processing", "Dependent tasks"]
  implementation:
    - Deploy agents in sequence
    - Pass results between agents
    - Monitor sequential progress
```

### 2. Parallel Coordination
```yaml
parallel:
  pattern: "Agents execute simultaneously"
  use_cases: ["Independent tasks", "Performance optimization"]
  implementation:
    - Deploy multiple agents
    - Execute tasks concurrently
    - Synchronize results
```

### 3. Hierarchical Coordination
```yaml
hierarchical:
  pattern: "Master agent coordinates sub-agents"
  use_cases: ["Complex analysis", "Distributed processing"]
  implementation:
    - Deploy master coordinator agent
    - Deploy specialized sub-agents
    - Manage hierarchical communication
```

## Implementation Patterns

### 1. Registry-Based Coordinator
```yaml
registry_based:
  pattern: "Central registry of available agents"
  implementation:
    - Maintain agent registry
    - Query registry for matches
    - Deploy from registry
  
  example:
    class: RegistryAgentCoordinator
    implements: AgentInterface
    registry: AgentRegistry
```

### 2. Factory-Based Coordinator
```yaml
factory_based:
  pattern: "Create agents on demand"
  implementation:
    - Define agent factories
    - Create agents per requirements
    - Manage agent lifecycle
  
  example:
    class: FactoryAgentCoordinator
    implements: AgentInterface
    factories: AgentFactory[]
```

### 3. Pool-Based Coordinator
```yaml
pool_based:
  pattern: "Manage pool of pre-created agents"
  implementation:
    - Maintain agent pools
    - Allocate from pools
    - Return to pools after use
  
  example:
    class: PoolAgentCoordinator
    implements: AgentInterface
    pools: Map<AgentType, AgentPool>
```

## SOLID Compliance Benefits

### Interface Segregation
- Focused solely on agent coordination
- No mixing with validation or execution logic
- Clients use only agent methods they need

### Single Responsibility
- Interface responsible only for agent coordination
- Clear separation from other concerns
- Cohesive agent operations

### Dependency Inversion
- Commands depend on agent abstraction
- Concrete coordinators implement interface
- Agent coordination logic is pluggable

### Open/Closed
- Interface stable for existing implementations
- Open for new coordination strategies
- Extensible without modification

## Composition with Commands

### Simple Agent Deployment
```yaml
simple_deployment:
  class: AuditCommand
  implements: CommandInterface
  
  dependencies:
    agent_coordinator: AgentInterface
  
  execute_method:
    - requirements = get_agent_requirements()
    - deployment = agent_coordinator.deploy_agent(requirements)
    - execute with deployed agent
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```yaml
multi_agent:
  class: ComplexAnalysisCommand
  implements: CommandInterface
  
  dependencies:
    agent_coordinator: AgentInterface
  
  execute_method:
    - Deploy multiple specialized agents
    - Coordinate parallel execution
    - Synthesize results from all agents
```

## Error Handling

### Agent Deployment Failures
```yaml
deployment_failures:
  no_suitable_agent:
    response: "Return deployment failure with explanation"
    fallback: "Suggest manual execution or alternative approaches"
  
  agent_unavailable:
    response: "Queue request or suggest alternatives"
    fallback: "Provide estimated wait time"
  
  deployment_timeout:
    response: "Cancel deployment and report timeout"
    fallback: "Retry with different agent or manual execution"
```

### Coordination Failures
```yaml
coordination_failures:
  agent_communication_failure:
    response: "Isolate failed agent and continue with others"
    fallback: "Restart failed agent or redistribute work"
  
  resource_conflicts:
    response: "Resolve conflicts or serialize access"
    fallback: "Queue conflicting operations"
  
  synchronization_issues:
    response: "Implement coordination checkpoints"
    fallback: "Fall back to sequential execution"
```
