# AGENT ORGANIZATION AUDIT

⏺ **Principle**: This command implements [agent-selection.md highest specialization priority](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md#selection-rules) by organizing agents into clear hierarchical structure with doctorate-level expertise boundaries.

## Command Purpose

Audit current agent folder structure, analyze scope overlaps, and implement hierarchical organization with clear specializations. Identify agents that need division for better expertise focus.

## Input Parameters

- `--scope` (required): Audit scope (structure|overlaps|specialization|reorganize|all)
- `--depth` (optional): Analysis depth (surface|comprehensive|expert-level) [default: comprehensive]
- `--reorganize` (optional): Execute reorganization (preview|implement) [default: preview]
- `--division-threshold` (optional): Scope complexity threshold for agent division [default: 3-domains]

## Execution Requirements

### Pre-Execution Validation
- [ ] **Agent Directory Access**: Full read/write access to /agents/ folder
- [ ] **Backup Creation**: Current agent structure backed up before changes
- [ ] **Agent Catalog Analysis**: Complete inventory of existing agents and capabilities
- [ ] **Specialization Framework**: Agent-selection.md principles accessible for guidance

### Execution Methodology

#### Phase 1: Current Structure Analysis
1. **Agent Inventory** - Complete catalog of existing agents with capability mapping
2. **Scope Documentation** - Extract and analyze each agent's domain expertise
3. **Overlap Detection** - Identify redundant or competing capabilities
4. **Specialization Assessment** - Evaluate current expertise depth vs. doctorate-level requirements

#### Phase 2: Hierarchical Design
1. **Domain Categorization** - Group agents by primary expertise domains
2. **Subfolder Structure** - Design logical hierarchy based on specialization areas
3. **Specialization Boundaries** - Define clear scope boundaries for each agent
4. **Division Candidates** - Identify agents with overly broad scope requiring division

#### Phase 3: Scope Definition and Division
1. **Expertise Assessment** - Analyze each agent for doctorate-level focus
2. **Division Analysis** - Identify agents covering multiple domains that should be split
3. **New Agent Requirements** - Define specifications for divided/missing specialists
4. **Scope Documentation** - Create clear expertise boundaries and responsibilities

#### Phase 4: Implementation Planning
1. **Reorganization Strategy** - Plan folder structure and agent movement
2. **Division Implementation** - Split overly broad agents into focused specialists
3. **Documentation Updates** - Update references and cross-links
4. **Validation Framework** - Ensure reorganization maintains system integrity
