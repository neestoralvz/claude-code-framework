# PLAN COMMAND

## Purpose

⏺ **Principle**: This command implements [workflow.md Phase 5](../docs/principles/workflow.md) by designing atomic, hierarchical implementation approaches, and applies [task-orchestration.md](../docs/principles/task-orchestration.md) through systematic task breakdown.

Execute detailed implementation planning by decomposing selected solutions into atomic, executable tasks with clear dependencies and agent assignments.

## Command Syntax

```bash
# Basic usage - comprehensive implementation planning
plan

# With specific planning scope
plan --scope [architecture|implementation|deployment|testing]

# With planning depth and methodology
plan --depth [high-level|detailed|comprehensive] --methodology [waterfall|iterative|hybrid]
```

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Solution Decomposition
- Break selected solution into logical components
- Identify atomic tasks and dependencies
- Map task relationships and sequencing
- Define component interfaces and integration points

### Phase 2: Resource Planning
- Identify required agents and capabilities
- Assess task complexity and effort estimates
- Plan agent deployment and coordination strategy
- Document resource requirements and constraints

### Phase 3: Implementation Sequencing
- Design optimal task execution sequence
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Plan validation checkpoints and milestones
- Structure implementation phases and gates

### Phase 4: Execution Strategy
- Define agent orchestration approach
- Plan coordination and communication patterns
- Establish monitoring and progress tracking
- Prepare implementation roadmap for execution

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
None - command processes solution selection outputs automatically

### Optional Parameters
- **--scope**: Focus planning on specific area (architecture|implementation|deployment|testing)
- **--depth**: Planning detail level (high-level|detailed|comprehensive)
- **--methodology**: Planning approach (waterfall|iterative|hybrid)
- **--agents**: Specify available agent catalog for assignment planning

## Expected Output

```bash
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
===================

Solution Overview:
- Selected Approach: [Chosen solution name and rationale]
- Implementation Scope: [Boundaries and deliverables]
- Success Criteria: [Measurable outcomes from clarification phase]

Agent Deployment Strategy:
┌─ Sequential Tasks
├─ Task A → agent-type-1 → Task B → agent-type-2
└─ Dependencies: Linear execution required

┌─ Parallel Tasks  
├─ Task C → agent-type-1 ┐
├─ Task D → agent-type-2 ├→ Synchronization Point
└─ Task E → agent-type-3 ┘

Implementation Roadmap:
Week 1: [Phase 1 activities and milestones]
Week 2: [Phase 2 activities and milestones]
Week 3: [Phase 3 activities and milestones]

Risk Mitigation:
- Risk: [Identified risk] → Mitigation: [Strategy]
- Risk: [Identified risk] → Mitigation: [Strategy]

Validation Checkpoints:
□ Phase 1 completion validated
□ Integration points tested
□ Success criteria verified
□ Ready for implementation execution
```

## Integration Points

### Workflow Integration
- Transforms selected solution into executable plan
- Establishes foundation for implementation phase
- Integrates with validation phase for checkpoint planning

### Agent Integration
- Maps tasks to appropriate agent specializations
- Plans agent coordination and sequencing
- Integrates with task-orchestration for execution strategy

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Selected solution decomposed into atomic tasks
- [ ] Task dependencies and sequencing defined
- [ ] Agent assignments and coordination planned
- [ ] Implementation roadmap created with milestones
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies documented
- [ ] Ready to proceed to implementation phase

## Usage Examples

### Comprehensive Planning
```bash
plan
# Expected result: Complete implementation plan with task breakdown and agent assignments
```

### Architecture-Focused Planning
```bash
plan --scope architecture --depth comprehensive
# Expected result: Detailed architectural implementation planning
```

### Iterative Methodology Planning
```bash
plan --methodology iterative --depth detailed
# Expected result: Iterative implementation plan with sprint-like phases
```
