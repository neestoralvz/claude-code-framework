# OPTIMIZATION CYCLE WORKFLOW

## Definition
Pre-built command composition that executes iterative system optimization through recursive workflow improvement and continuous quality enhancement.

⏺ **Principle**: This composition implements [Apply command-workflow-principles.md systematic recursive execution](../../docs/principles/command-workflow-principles.md#recursive-improvement) through systematic recursive execution for continuous quality improvement.

## Command Composition

### Basic Optimization Cycle
```bash
# Single iteration optimization
8-validate --depth comprehensive |
[if criteria_not_met] 10-recurse --strategy adaptive |
../analysis/system-audit --focus quality |
[if issues_found] ../execution/execute-ticket --priority HIGH |
8-validate --criteria improved
```

### Multi-Iteration Cycle
```bash
# Iterative improvement with bounds
for i in {1..3}; do
  8-validate --depth comprehensive |
  [if quality_score < 0.9] 10-recurse --iteration $i |
  ../analysis/modularize --search |
  [if patterns_found] ../execution/execute-parallel-plan |
  8-validate --criteria enhanced
done
```

### Adaptive Optimization
```bash
# Adaptive optimization based on results
8-validate --depth comprehensive |
while [quality_metrics.improvable]; do
  10-recurse --strategy $(determine_strategy) |
  ../analysis/analyze-dependencies --focus bottlenecks |
  ../execution/execute-ticket --priority optimization |
  8-validate --criteria progressive
done
```

## Optimization Strategies

### Quality-Driven Optimization
- **Performance Focus**: Target execution time and resource usage
- **Maintainability Focus**: Improve code organization and documentation
- **Reliability Focus**: Enhance error handling and recovery
- **Security Focus**: Address vulnerabilities and compliance

### Iteration Strategies
- `--strategy conservative`: Small, safe improvements
- `--strategy aggressive`: Larger changes with higher impact
- `--strategy adaptive`: Dynamic strategy based on current state
- `--strategy targeted`: Focus on specific quality dimensions

### Termination Criteria
- **Quality Threshold**: Stop when target quality score reached
- **Improvement Rate**: Stop when improvement rate falls below threshold
- **Resource Limits**: Stop when time/effort budget exceeded
- **Manual Override**: Allow manual termination with reason

## Configuration Options

### Iteration Parameters
- `--max-iterations`: Maximum number of optimization cycles
- `--quality-threshold`: Target quality score for termination
- `--improvement-threshold`: Minimum improvement rate to continue

### Focus Areas
- `--focus performance`: Optimize for speed and efficiency
- `--focus maintainability`: Improve code organization and clarity
- `--focus reliability`: Enhance error handling and robustness
- `--focus security`: Address security vulnerabilities

### Validation Depth
- `--validation basic`: Quick quality checks
- `--validation standard`: Comprehensive quality assessment
- `--validation exhaustive`: Detailed quality analysis with metrics

## Success Criteria

### Optimization Completion
- [ ] Target quality thresholds achieved
- [ ] All identified improvements implemented
- [ ] Validation criteria satisfied
- [ ] Performance metrics improved
- [ ] System stability maintained

### Quality Improvement
- [ ] Measurable quality score increase
- [ ] Reduced technical debt
- [ ] Improved maintainability metrics
- [ ] Enhanced performance characteristics
- [ ] Increased reliability measures

## Usage Examples

### Performance Optimization
```bash
optimization-cycle --focus performance --max-iterations 5 --quality-threshold 0.9
```

### Code Quality Improvement
```bash
optimization-cycle --focus maintainability --improvement-threshold 0.05 --validation comprehensive
```

### Comprehensive System Optimization
```bash
optimization-cycle --strategy adaptive --max-iterations 10 --validation exhaustive
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Progress Tracking
```json
{
  "optimization_progress": {
    "current_iteration": 3,
    "quality_score": 0.85,
    "improvement_rate": 0.12,
    "target_threshold": 0.9,
    "estimated_completion": "2 iterations"
  }
}
```

### Quality Metrics
- **Performance**: Execution time, memory usage, throughput
- **Maintainability**: Code complexity, documentation coverage, test coverage
- **Reliability**: Error rates, recovery time, stability metrics
- **Security**: Vulnerability count, compliance score, security coverage

## Integration Points

### Input Requirements
- Current system state and baseline metrics
- Optimization focus areas and priorities
- Quality thresholds and termination criteria

### Output Products
- Quality improvement reports
