# RECURSE COMMAND

## Purpose

‚è∫ **Principle**: This command implements [workflow.md recursive capability](../docs/principles/workflow.md) by enabling systematic workflow iteration for continuous improvement, and applies [validation-methodology.md](../docs/components/validation-methodology.md) through iterative enhancement cycles.

Execute intelligent workflow recursion to address validation gaps, incorporate new requirements, and achieve higher quality standards through systematic iteration.

## Command Syntax

```bash
# Basic usage - intelligent recursion based on validation results
recurse

# With specific recursion scope and starting phase
recurse --scope [partial|targeted|comprehensive] --from-phase [phase-number]

# With iteration strategy and improvement focus
recurse --strategy [incremental|adaptive|transformative] --focus [quality|requirements|optimization]
```

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Recursion Analysis
- Analyze validation results and identified improvement opportunities
- Determine optimal recursion strategy and starting phase
- Map requirement evolution and quality enhancement needs
- Plan iteration scope and success criteria adjustments

### Phase 2: Iteration Planning
- Design targeted improvement approach based on validation gaps
- Select optimal workflow phase entry point for recursion
- Plan agent redeployment with enhanced capabilities
- Establish iteration success criteria and exit conditions

### Phase 3: Recursive Execution
- Execute workflow phases from determined starting point
- Apply lessons learned and enhanced methodologies
- Coordinate improved agent deployment and coordination
- Monitor iteration progress and quality improvements

### Phase 4: Convergence Validation
- Validate iteration results against enhanced success criteria
- Assess improvement achievement and quality gains
- Determine iteration completion or additional recursion needs
- Document learning outcomes and methodology enhancements

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
None - command analyzes validation outputs automatically

### Optional Parameters
- **--scope**: Recursion extent (partial|targeted|comprehensive)
- **--from-phase**: Starting phase for recursion (1-8 or phase-name)
- **--strategy**: Iteration approach (incremental|adaptive|transformative)
- **--focus**: Primary improvement target (quality|requirements|optimization)

## Expected Output

```bash
