# DEBUG COMMAND

## Purpose

‚è∫ **Principle**: This command implements [workflow.md diagnostic capability](../docs/principles/workflow.md) by providing systematic troubleshooting for workflow execution issues, and applies [fundamental.md evidence approach](../docs/principles/fundamental.md) through root cause analysis.

Execute comprehensive debugging of workflow phases, agent coordination, and execution barriers to identify and resolve systematic issues.

## Command Syntax

```bash
# Basic usage - comprehensive workflow debugging
debug

# With specific debugging scope
debug --scope [phase|agent|integration|validation]

# With diagnostic depth and focus
debug --depth [surface|detailed|root-cause] --focus [blockages|quality|performance]
```

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Issue Discovery
- Analyze current workflow state and execution history
- Identify failed validations, blocked phases, and error patterns
- Map agent coordination issues and communication failures
- Document symptom patterns and impact assessment

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
- Trace execution paths to identify failure origins
- Analyze agent outputs and coordination breakdowns
- Examine validation failures and quality issues
- Investigate dependency conflicts and resource constraints

### Phase 3: Solution Generation
- Design targeted fixes for identified root causes
- Generate recovery strategies and workaround procedures
- Plan agent redeployment and coordination improvements
- Develop validation enhancements and quality gates

### Phase 4: Resolution Implementation
- Execute fixes and recovery procedures systematically
- Redeploy agents with improved coordination
- Implement enhanced validation and monitoring
- Verify resolution effectiveness and document lessons learned

## Parameters

### Required Parameters
None - command analyzes current workflow state automatically

### Optional Parameters
- **--scope**: Focus debugging on specific area (phase|agent|integration|validation)
- **--depth**: Diagnostic thoroughness (surface|detailed|root-cause)
- **--focus**: Problem category priority (blockages|quality|performance)
- **--phase**: Target specific workflow phase for debugging

## Expected Output

```bash
WORKFLOW DEBUG ANALYSIS
=======================

Execution Status Overview:
‚îå‚îÄ Current Phase: [Phase Name] - [Status]
‚îú‚îÄ Overall Progress: [X]% complete
‚îú‚îÄ Active Issues: [N] problems identified
‚îî‚îÄ System Health: [Healthy/Degraded/Critical]

Issue Identification:

üö® CRITICAL ISSUES
‚îú‚îÄ Issue 1: [Description of critical problem]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Phase: [Affected workflow phase]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Impact: [Severity and scope assessment]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Root Cause: [Underlying cause analysis]
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Resolution: [Recommended fix strategy]
‚îî‚îÄ Issue 2: [Description of critical problem]
    ‚îî‚îÄ [Similar structure...]

‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING ISSUES
‚îú‚îÄ Issue A: [Description of warning-level problem]
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Potential Impact: [Risk assessment]
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Mitigation: [Prevention strategy]
‚îî‚îÄ Issue B: [Description of warning-level problem]

Agent Coordination Analysis:
‚îå‚îÄ Active Agents: [N] deployed
‚îú‚îÄ Communication Status: [Healthy/Issues/Failed]
‚îú‚îÄ Dependency Conflicts: [N] conflicts detected
‚îî‚îÄ Resource Utilization: [Efficiency metrics]

Phase-Specific Diagnostics:
‚úÖ Phase 1 (Clarification): No issues detected
‚ùå Phase 2 (Exploration): Context gathering incomplete
üîÑ Phase 3 (Analysis): Currently executing with delays
‚è≥ Phase 4 (Presentation): Pending Phase 3 completion

Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate**: [High-priority action with timeline]
2. **Short-term**: [Medium-priority action with timeline]
3. **Long-term**: [Preventive measure for future]

Recovery Plan:
‚ñ° Execute critical issue resolutions
‚ñ° Restart failed agent deployments
‚ñ° Validate phase completion criteria
‚ñ° Resume workflow execution from stable point

DEBUG ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Resolution Plan Available
```

## Integration Points

### Workflow Integration
- Provides diagnostic capability for any workflow phase
- Enables recovery and continuation from failure points
- Integrates with validation systems for quality assurance

### Agent Integration
- Diagnoses agent coordination and communication issues
- Enables agent redeployment and configuration fixes
- Provides agent performance and efficiency analysis

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All workflow execution issues identified and categorized
- [ ] Root cause analysis completed for critical problems
- [ ] Resolution strategies developed and documented
- [ ] Recovery plan established with clear action items
- [ ] System ready for resumed or restarted execution

## Usage Examples

### Comprehensive Workflow Debug
```bash
debug
# Expected result: Complete diagnostic analysis of entire workflow execution
```

### Agent-Focused Debugging
```bash
debug --scope agent --depth root-cause
# Expected result: Deep analysis of agent coordination and communication issues
```

### Phase-Specific Troubleshooting
```bash
debug --phase 3 --focus blockages
# Expected result: Targeted debugging of Phase 3 execution blockages
```
