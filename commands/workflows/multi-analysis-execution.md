## Integrated Execution Environment

⏺ **Architecture**: This command serves as a COMPLETE EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT for multi-analysis workflows, handling the entire lifecycle from user request to orchestrator-ready reports with JSON-based agent coordination.

### Command Responsibility
1. **Analyze user request** to determine required analysis types
2. **Deploy specialized agents** in parallel for JSON output generation
3. **Coordinate analysis execution** across multiple analytical perspectives
4. **Synthesize JSON outputs** through report-generator agent
5. **Deliver consolidated reports** to orchestrator for decision-making

### Embedded Principle Application
- **[Apply intent-recognition.md analysis detection](../../docs/principles/intent-recognition.md#intent-analysis-matrix)**: Automatic analysis type identification
- **[Apply agent-selection.md specialized deployment](../../docs/principles/agent-selection.md)**: Expert agent matching and coordination
- **[Apply workflow.md systematic execution](../../docs/principles/workflow.md)**: Eight-phase methodology for comprehensive analysis

## Analysis Type Detection

⏺ **Principle**: Detection implements [intent-recognition.md pattern recognition](../../docs/principles/intent-recognition.md#pattern-recognition-rules) by analyzing user requests for analytical requirements and mapping to appropriate specialist agents.

### Detection Framework
```yaml
analysis_type_detection:
  business_metrics:
    triggers: ["revenue", "sales", "market", "customer", "growth", "performance"]
    agent: "sales-analyst"
    output: "sales-analysis.json"
    
  system_discovery:
    triggers: ["explore", "architecture", "patterns", "opportunities", "discovery"]
    agent: "exploration-analyst"
    output: "exploration-analysis.json"
    
  knowledge_synthesis:
    triggers: ["research", "competitive", "trends", "best practices", "evidence"]
    agent: "research-analyst"
    output: "research-analysis.json"
    
  intent_mapping:
    triggers: ["analyze request", "understand requirements", "map intent"]
    agent: "general-purpose"
    output: "intent-analysis.json"
```

### Detection Logic
1. **Keyword Analysis**: Extract domain-specific terms from user request
2. **Context Assessment**: Evaluate request complexity and scope
3. **Agent Mapping**: Match requirements to specialist capabilities
4. **Output Planning**: Define JSON structure and file organization
5. **Validation Setup**: Establish success criteria and quality metrics

### Analysis Type Combinations
- **Business Decision**: sales-analyst + research-analyst + exploration-analyst
- **Technical Implementation**: exploration-analyst + research-analyst + intent-analysis
- **Market Strategy**: sales-analyst + research-analyst + competitive intelligence
- **System Optimization**: exploration-analyst + sales-analyst (performance metrics)

## Parallel Agent Orchestration

⏺ **Principle**: Orchestration implements [task-orchestration.md parallel coordination](../../docs/principles/task-orchestration.md) by deploying multiple specialized agents simultaneously with synchronized JSON output generation.

### Orchestration Architecture
```yaml
parallel_execution_pattern:
  coordination_method: "synchronized_json_generation"
  output_management: "conversation_isolated_storage"
  quality_control: "schema_validation_and_confidence_scoring"
  
agent_deployment_strategy:
  phase_1_analysis:
    - sales_analyst: "business_metrics_and_performance_analysis"
    - exploration_analyst: "system_discovery_and_pattern_analysis" 
    - research_analyst: "knowledge_synthesis_and_competitive_intelligence"
    - general_purpose: "intent_analysis_and_context_mapping"
    
  phase_2_synthesis:
    - report_generator: "json_processing_and_report_consolidation"
    
  phase_3_delivery:
    - orchestrator_interface: "decision_ready_report_delivery"
```

### Agent Coordination Protocol
1. **Simultaneous Deployment**: All analysis agents launched concurrently
2. **Independent Execution**: Agents work autonomously with shared context
3. **JSON Output Generation**: Structured data following defined schemas
4. **Storage Coordination**: Conversation-isolated file management
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking and error handling

### Parallel Execution Framework
**Sales Analyst Deployment**:
```
Task: Analyze business metrics, revenue performance, market positioning
Input: User request + business context
Output: ./operations/{conversation-id}/analyses/sales-analysis.json
Schema: Sales analysis JSON schema with confidence scoring
```

**Exploration Analyst Deployment**:
```
Task: Discover system patterns, architectural opportunities, optimization areas
Input: User request + system context
Output: ./operations/{conversation-id}/analyses/exploration-analysis.json
Schema: Exploration analysis JSON schema with coverage metrics
```

**Research Analyst Deployment**:
```
Task: Synthesize knowledge, competitive intelligence, best practices
Input: User request + research scope
Output: ./operations/{conversation-id}/analyses/research-analysis.json
Schema: Research analysis JSON schema with evidence quality
```

## Report Generation Pipeline

⏺ **Principle**: Pipeline implements [engineering.md systematic processing](../../docs/principles/engineering.md) by transforming multiple JSON analyses into consolidated, orchestrator-ready reports through automated synthesis.

### Pipeline Architecture
```yaml
report_generation_workflow:
  input_validation:
    - verify_json_schema_compliance
    - assess_analysis_completeness
    - validate_confidence_scores
    
  synthesis_processing:
    - deploy_report_generator_agent
    - process_multiple_json_inputs
    - generate_cross_analysis_insights
    - create_decision_support_matrices
    
  output_generation:
    - consolidated_report_json
    - executive_summary_json
    - decision_matrix_json
    - orchestrator_guidance_package
```

### Report Generator Integration
1. **JSON Input Processing**: Validate and parse all analysis outputs
2. **Cross-Analysis Synthesis**: Identify convergent themes and conflicts
3. **Decision Matrix Creation**: Rank options with weighted scoring
4. **Executive Summary Generation**: High-level strategic overview
5. **Orchestrator Guidance**: Actionable recommendations and next steps

### Output File Structure
```
./operations/{conversation-id}/
├── analyses/
│   ├── sales-analysis.json
│   ├── exploration-analysis.json
│   ├── research-analysis.json
│   └── intent-analysis.json
├── reports/
│   ├── consolidated-report.json      # Primary orchestrator input
│   ├── executive-summary.json        # Strategic overview
│   └── decision-matrix.json          # Decision support framework
└── metadata/
    ├── execution-log.json             # Agent deployment tracking
    └── quality-assessment.json        # Validation results
```

## Orchestrator Interface

⏺ **Principle**: Interface implements [communication.md clear actionable results](../../docs/principles/communication.md) by providing structured, decision-ready reports that enable immediate orchestrator action.

### Orchestrator Input Format
```json
{
  "orchestrator_package": {
    "primary_input": "./operations/{conversation-id}/reports/consolidated-report.json",
    "executive_overview": "./operations/{conversation-id}/reports/executive-summary.json",
    "decision_framework": "./operations/{conversation-id}/reports/decision-matrix.json",
    "execution_metadata": "./operations/{conversation-id}/metadata/execution-log.json"
  },
  "decision_guidance": {
    "recommended_action": "immediate|planned|research_needed|escalate",
    "confidence_level": 0.89,
