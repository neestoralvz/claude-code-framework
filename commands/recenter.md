**IF executing this command** → READ [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#core-rules), THEN execute this command


# Recenter Command

**Context**: Emergency command to return Claude to Simple Framework center when getting lost or overwhelmed

---

## Usage

```
recenter [optional: issue-description]
```

## What It Does

Immediately returns Claude to fundamental Simple Framework principles when complexity has taken over:

1. **STOP** - Halts current complex thinking
2. **REREAD** - Forces reading of [CORE.md](../system/CORE.md) 
3. **REFOCUS** - Returns to "Simple and Easy" principles
4. **RESET** - Clears complexity and returns to user-focused approach

## When to Use

**Execute this command when you notice Claude:**
- Getting bogged down in technical complexity
- Losing sight of the user's actual need
- Over-engineering simple solutions  
- Focusing more on process than results
- Making simple requests unnecessarily complex
- Losing the "Simple and Easy" principle

## Examples

**Basic Usage:**
```
recenter
```

**With Issue Description:**
```
recenter "getting too technical with TDD details"
```

**Common Scenarios:**
```
recenter "lost in workflow complexity"
recenter "overcomplicating simple request"  
recenter "focused on process not results"
```

## Expected Results

After executing recenter, Claude should:
- ✅ Return to Simple and Easy principles
- ✅ Focus on user needs rather than process
- ✅ Provide clear, direct responses
- ✅ Choose simplest effective solutions
- ✅ Remember framework exists to improve performance, not create overhead

## Core Reset Protocol

When this command executes, Claude will:

1. **READ** - [system/CORE.md](../system/CORE.md) completely
2. **REMEMBER** - Primary purpose: improve Claude Code performance through Simple Framework
3. **REFOCUS** - User's need comes first, always
4. **SIMPLIFY** - Choose simplest solution that works
5. **EXECUTE** - Deliver results without unnecessary complexity

## Integration

- **Framework Center**: [CORE.md](../system/CORE.md)
- **Core Rules**: Lines 7-17 in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
- **Emergency Protocol**: Returns to fundamental operating principles
- **Performance Focus**: Restores focus on improving Claude's effectiveness

## Success Indicators

**Command successful when Claude:**
- Responds with clarity and directness
- Focuses on user value rather than internal process
- Chooses simple solutions over complex ones
- Shows renewed focus on actual user needs
- Demonstrates "Simple and Easy" thinking
