# MIGRATION STRATEGY - SOLID TRANSITION

## Purpose

‚è∫ **Systematic Migration**: This strategy provides a systematic approach to migrating existing commands to SOLID-compliant architecture while maintaining full functionality throughout the transition.

## Migration Overview

```yaml
migration_phases:
  phase_1_assessment:
    duration: "1-2 days"
    deliverables: ["violation_analysis", "migration_plan", "priority_matrix"]
    
  phase_2_foundation:
    duration: "2-3 days"
    deliverables: ["core_modules", "interfaces", "base_implementations"]
    
  phase_3_migration:
    duration: "3-5 days"
    deliverables: ["migrated_commands", "integration_tests", "validation"]
    
  phase_4_optimization:
    duration: "1-2 days"
    deliverables: ["performance_tuning", "documentation", "training"]
```

## Current Architecture Analysis

### 1. SOLID Violations Identified
```yaml
current_violations:
  single_responsibility:
    - Commands mixing validation, execution, and documentation
    - Monolithic command implementations
    - Multiple concerns in single methods
  
  open_closed:
    - Commands tightly coupled to specific implementations
    - Hard-coded validation and agent logic
    - Modification required for extension
  
  interface_segregation:
    - Large command interfaces with many concerns
    - Forced implementation of unused features
    - Monolithic command contracts
  
  dependency_inversion:
    - Commands depending on concrete implementations
    - Hard-coded dependencies on specific frameworks
    - No abstraction layers for external dependencies
```

### 2. Current Command Structure
```yaml
current_structure:
  command_files:
    location: "/Users/nalve/.claude/commands/"
    categories: ["analysis", "workflow", "management", "orchestration"]
    total_commands: 45+
    complexity: "High - monolithic implementations"
  
  common_patterns:
    - Embedded validation logic
