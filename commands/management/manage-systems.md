# Manage Systems Command

## Purpose
Centralized command for managing all Claude Code framework systems including hooks, registries, and password management.

## Usage

```bash
# System status check
manage-systems status

# Enable/disable systems
manage-systems enable hooks
manage-systems disable password-manager

# System health check
manage-systems health

# Initialize all systems
manage-systems init

# Backup all systems
manage-systems backup

# Restore from backup
manage-systems restore <backup_file>
```

## Implementation

⏺ **Principle**: This command implements [task-orchestration.md systematic execution](docs/principles/task-orchestration.md) for system management and applies [engineering.md quality standards](docs/principles/engineering.md) for operational excellence.

### Phase 1: Status Assessment
1. Check hooks system status and configuration
2. Validate registry system integrity
3. Verify password manager security settings
4. Assess system integration health

### Phase 2: System Operations
1. Execute requested system operation
2. Update system configurations
3. Validate operation success
4. Update system registries

### Phase 3: Validation
1. Verify system operation completed successfully
2. Check system integration integrity
3. Validate security configurations
4. Confirm operational status

## Agent Deployment

**Primary Agent**: system-auditor
- **Purpose**: System status assessment and validation
- **Capabilities**: Static analysis, compliance validation, system integrity
- **Tools**: Grep, LS, Read, Bash, TodoWrite

**Secondary Agent**: configuration-manager (if needed)
- **Purpose**: Configuration management and system orchestration  
- **Capabilities**: Configuration drift detection, environment orchestration
- **Tools**: Read, Edit, Bash, LS, Grep

## System Commands

### Status Command
```bash
# Check all systems
./scripts/hooks-executor.sh list
./scripts/registry-manager.sh list
./scripts/password-manager.sh list

# Check system health
./scripts/hooks-executor.sh system startup
```

### Enable/Disable Commands
```bash
# Enable hooks
jq '.hooks.UserPromptSubmit[0].hooks[0].enabled = true' settings.json

# Disable password manager
export CLAUDE_PASSWORD_MANAGER_ENABLED=false
```

### Health Check Command
```bash
# Validate all registries
for registry in components agents services; do
    ./scripts/registry-manager.sh validate $registry
done

# Check vault security
ls -la scripts/vault/
```

### Backup Command
```bash
# Backup all systems
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
tar -czf "backups/systems_backup_${timestamp}.tar.gz" \
    scripts/registries/ \
    scripts/hooks-registry.json \
    scripts/vault/ \
    settings.json
```

## Integration Points

### Hooks System Integration
- **Event Triggers**: System events trigger appropriate hooks
- **Configuration**: Hooks configuration in settings.json
- **Logging**: Centralized hook execution logging

### Registry System Integration  
- **Component Tracking**: Automatic component discovery and registration
- **Service Monitoring**: Service health and capability tracking
- **Configuration Management**: Registry-based configuration storage

### Password System Integration
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted password and secret storage
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive access audit trails

## Validation Framework

### Requirements Gate
- [ ] All system components are installed and configured
- [ ] Security configurations meet policy requirements
- [ ] Integration points are properly configured
- [ ] Access controls are properly implemented

### Process Gate  
- [ ] System commands execute without errors
- [ ] Configuration changes are properly validated
- [ ] Security policies are enforced
- [ ] Audit logging is functional

### Output Gate
- [ ] System status is accurately reported
- [ ] All operations complete successfully
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### System Gate
- [ ] No system regressions introduced
- [ ] Security posture is maintained or improved
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Integration integrity is preserved

## Quality Assurance

### Engineering Standards
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth security architecture
- **Performance**: Minimal impact on system performance
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Individual system component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-system integration validation
- **Security Tests**: Security configuration validation
- **Performance Tests**: System impact assessment

## Documentation Requirements

### System Documentation
- Update system status in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
- Document configuration changes
- Update integration diagrams
- Maintain troubleshooting guides

### User Documentation
- Command usage examples
- Troubleshooting procedures
- Security best practices
- Configuration guidelines
