# Intelligent Command Selection System

⏺ **Principle**: Implement [directive.md ultimate authority](../../docs/principles/directive.md) through context-aware command analysis and apply [workflow.md systematic execution](../../docs/principles/workflow.md) for optimal task-command matching.

## Command Purpose

Provide intelligent command selection system that analyzes current system state against compliance requirements and recommends optimal enforcement commands based on violation severity, system context, and predictive analysis.

## Command Execution

### Phase 1: Context Analysis Engine

**Execute comprehensive system context assessment:**

#### Current System State Analysis
```
System Context Evaluation Matrix:
┌─────────────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────────┐
│ System Component    │ Status Check   │ Health Metric    │ Command Impact    │
├─────────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────────┼───────────────────┤
│ CLAUDE.md Authority │ Authority Load │ Compliance Rate  │ High Priority     │
│ Command Framework   │ Delegation     │ Success Rate     │ Critical Impact   │
│ Agent Coordination  │ Deployment     │ Response Time    │ Medium Priority   │
│ Quality Gates       │ Validation     │ Completion Rate  │ High Impact       │
│ Session State       │ Initialization │ Stability Index  │ Critical Priority │
└─────────────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

#### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
1. **System Readiness Assessment**
   - Current initialization completion status (0-100%)
   - Recent command execution success patterns
   - Resource availability and performance metrics
   - Historical violation patterns and trends

2. **Task Complexity Evaluation**
   - Simple tasks: Single command execution sufficient
   - Complex tasks: Multi-command sequence required
   - System-critical tasks: Enhanced validation needed
   - Emergency tasks: Immediate response protocols

3. **Context-Aware Weighting Algorithm**
   ```
   Command Selection Score = (
       (System Health × 0.3) +
       (Task Match × 0.4) +
       (Success History × 0.2) +
       (Resource Efficiency × 0.1)
   )
   
   Where:
   - System Health: Current system state compatibility
