    - Load phase metadata
    - Register available phases
  
  configuration_based:
    - Define phase sequence in config
    - Map phases to implementations
    - Configure phase parameters
```

### 3. Phase Customization
```yaml

    - Add custom phases
    - Modify phase sequence
  
  context_dependent:
    - Conditional phase execution
    - Dynamic phase selection
    - Adaptive phase configuration
```

## Execution Patterns

### 1. Sequential Execution
```yaml
sequential_execution:
  pattern: "Execute phases in order"
  implementation:
    class: SequentialWorkflowEngine
    
    execute():
      - For each phase in sequence
      - Execute phase with context
      - Validate phase results
      - Transition to next phase
```

### 2. Conditional Execution
```yaml
conditional_execution:
  pattern: "Execute phases based on conditions"
  implementation:
    class: ConditionalWorkflowEngine
    
    execute():
      - Evaluate phase conditions
      - Execute applicable phases
      - Skip phases not meeting conditions
      - Adapt sequence dynamically
```

### 3. Parallel Execution
```yaml
parallel_execution:
  pattern: "Execute independent phases in parallel"
  implementation:
    class: ParallelWorkflowEngine
    
    execute():
      - Identify independent phases
      - Execute phases concurrently
      - Synchronize at dependency points
      - Aggregate parallel results
```

## State Management

### 1. Execution Context
```yaml
ExecutionContext:
  workflow_id: string
  current_phase: string
  phase_history: PhaseExecution[]
  accumulated_data: Map<string, any>
  execution_metadata: ExecutionMetadata
```

### 2. Phase Context
```yaml
PhaseContext:
  phase_id: string
  input_data: Map<string, any>
  execution_context: ExecutionContext
  configuration: PhaseConfig
  resources: ResourceAllocation
```

### 3. Checkpoint Management
```yaml
checkpoint_management:
  automatic_checkpoints:
    - Save state after each phase
    - Create recovery points
    - Enable workflow resumption
  
  manual_checkpoints:
    - User-triggered save points
    - Custom checkpoint logic
    - Conditional checkpoint creation
```

## Configuration System

### 1. Engine Configuration
```yaml
engine_config:
  execution_mode: "sequential" | "conditional" | "parallel"
  phase_plugins: string[]
  checkpoint_strategy: "automatic" | "manual" | "hybrid"
  error_handling: "fail_fast" | "continue" | "retry"
  parallel_execution_limit: number
```

### 2. Phase Configuration
```yaml
phase_config:
  enabled_phases: string[]
  phase_sequence: string[]
  phase_parameters: Map<PhaseId, Parameters>
  conditional_logic: Map<PhaseId, Condition>
  timeout_settings: Map<PhaseId, number>
```

### 3. Workflow Configuration
```yaml
workflow_config:
  workflow_templates: Map<WorkflowType, PhaseSequence>
  custom_workflows: Map<WorkflowId, WorkflowDefinition>
  default_workflow: string
  workflow_variants: Map<Context, WorkflowModification>
```

## Implementation Examples

  extends: WorkflowEngine
  
  specialized_phases:
    - SystemAnalysisPhase
    - ViolationDetectionPhase
    - TicketGenerationPhase
    - ValidationPhase
  
  workflow_sequence:
    - clarify: "Define audit scope"
    - explore: "Gather system information"
    - analyze: "Detect violations and issues"
    - present: "Present audit findings"
    - plan: "Plan remediation actions"
    - implement: "Generate tickets and updates"
    - ripple: "Update registries and documentation"
    - validate: "Verify audit completion"
```

  class: TicketCreationWorkflowEngine
  extends: WorkflowEngine
  
  specialized_phases:
    - TaskAnalysisPhase
    - CategoryDetectionPhase
    - TemplateApplicationPhase
    - RegistryIntegrationPhase
  
  workflow_sequence:

    - present: "Show ticket preview"
    - plan: "Design ticket structure"
    - implement: "Create ticket file"
    - ripple: "Update registry and cross-references"
    - validate: "Verify ticket creation"
```

## SOLID Compliance Benefits

### Single Responsibility
- Engine focused solely on workflow orchestration
- Phases handle specific workflow logic
- Clear separation of concerns

### Open/Closed

- Plugin architecture enables customization

### Liskov Substitution
- All phase implementations are interchangeable
- Common phase interface enables substitution
- Workflow engines are interchangeable

### Interface Segregation
- Minimal phase interfaces
- Focused workflow contracts
- No forced implementation of unused features

### Dependency Inversion
- Engine depends on phase abstractions
- Phases implement standard interfaces
- Workflow logic is pluggable

## Error Handling and Recovery

### 1. Phase Failures
```yaml
phase_failures:
  execution_error:
    response: "Log error and attempt recovery"
    fallback: "Skip phase or use fallback implementation"
  
  validation_error:
    response: "Retry phase with corrected inputs"
    fallback: "Manual intervention or workflow suspension"
  
  timeout_error:
    response: "Cancel phase and log timeout"
    fallback: "Resume from checkpoint or restart workflow"
```

### 2. Workflow Recovery
```yaml
workflow_recovery:
  checkpoint_recovery:
    - Restore from last checkpoint
    - Resume workflow execution
    - Validate restored state
  
  partial_recovery:
    - Identify completed phases
    - Resume from failure point
    - Skip completed work
  
  full_restart:
    - Clear workflow state
    - Restart from beginning
    - Preserve failure context for analysis
```
