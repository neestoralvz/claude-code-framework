## Agent Selection Framework

### Core Selection Logic

#### Workflow Phase Selection
```yaml
core_workflow_selection:
  rule: "Use designated primary agent for workflow phase"
  selection_map:
    clarification: "business-analyst"
    exploration: "exploration-analyst"
    research: "research-analyst"
    analysis: "research-analyst"
    present_solutions: "technical-writer"
    planning: "workflow-coordinator"
    implementation: "ticket-executor-agent"
    ripple_effect: "integration-coordinator"
    validation: "validation-engineer"
```

#### Specialization Agent Selection
```yaml
specialization_selection:
  trigger: "Deploy when domain expertise required"
  selection_criteria:
    technology_context: "Match agent to technology stack"
    domain_expertise: "Select based on business domain"
    quality_requirements: "Choose quality specialists as needed"
    complexity_level: "Scale agent deployment to task complexity"
```

#### Context-Based Deployment
```yaml
deployment_patterns:
  simple_task: "Primary agent only"
  moderate_complexity: "Primary agent + 1 specialist"
  complex_task: "Primary agent + multiple specialists"
  enterprise_task: "Multi-phase coordination with specialist teams"
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Standard Workflow Coordination
**Pattern**: Sequential execution through 8 workflow phases
- Primary agent executes phase objectives
- Specialization agents deployed as needed for domain expertise
- Clear handoff between phases with defined success criteria

#### Multi-Agent Task Coordination  
**Pattern**: Primary agent coordinates specialists when required
- **Simple deployment**: Primary agent handles task independently
- **Complex deployment**: Primary agent coordinates 1-3 specialists
- **Enterprise deployment**: Multi-phase coordination with specialist teams

#### Quality Assurance Integration
**Pattern**: Quality specialists integrate at validation checkpoints
- Continuous quality monitoring through workflow phases
- Validation-engineer oversees comprehensive quality gates
- Domain specialists provide targeted quality assessments
